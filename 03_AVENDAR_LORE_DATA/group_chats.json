load\n- Patterns emerge only at scale\n- AI doesn\u2019t get bored or fatigued\n\n### Guardrail\nAI summarizes \u2014 **you approve meaning**\n\n\u2705 **Use AI here with review**\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 COMPARISON ACROSS TIME (Pattern Detection)\nThis is where AI quietly becomes powerful.\n\n### Examples\n- \u201cEnergy dips every Wednesday\u201d\n- \u201cSame question logged 6 times\u201d\n- \u201cSprint mode fails after 9pm\u201d\n\n### Why AI belongs here\n- Humans are terrible at longitudinal memory\n- AI is great at spotting frequency and correlation\n- No ego

The Three Most Valuable Parts for *Your* Setup\n\n## **1. M0 \u2014 Planning Phase (You need this)**\nThis is universal, not PT\u2011only.\n\nFor ANY area of your life or business work:\n- What\u2019s the target?  \n- What\u2019s your current position?  \n- What materials/resources do you need?  \n- What\u2019s the 3\u20135 step plan?  \n- What\u2019s your 1\u20133 item pre-test or \u201cbrain dump\u201d?\n\n**Why you want this:**  \nIt kills drift, kills overwhelm, and creates clarity. This is the \u201cget your head straight before doing anything\u201d move.\n\nYou can use M0 for:\n- Work tasks  \n- Projects  \n- Personal improvements  \n- Training  \n- Business planning  \n\nIt\u2019s basically a stronger version of your morning ops.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Mode System (Core / Sprint / Drill / Light / Quick Sprint)**  \nThis is insanely helpful for YOU because you bounce between energy states and task types.\n\n- **Core** \u2192 when learning new shit  \n- **Sprint** \u2192 when you need to stress test or ship  \n- **Drill** \u2192 when a specific weakness keeps showing up  \n- **Light** \u2192 when you\u2019re low energy or short on time  \n- **Quick Sprint** \u2192 when you want a quick 20\u201330 minute burst\n\n**Why you need modes:**  \nYou\u2019ll stop treating every task like the same kind of task.  \nModes save energy by matching workflow to mental state.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Wrap Protocol (M6) \u2014 THIS is your gold**\nTrey\u2019s Wrap is basically a structured **end-of-block review**.\n\nFor your setup:\n- Recap top 2\u20133 insights  \n- Log errors or misses  \n- Create 1\u20133 to\u2011dos or cards  \n- Set next review (24h / 3d / 7d)\n\nFor your own operations (work, habits, personal goals), this becomes:\n\n> \u201cWhat did I do, what did I miss, and what\u2019s the next checkpoint?\u201d\n\nThis will drastically sharpen your self-awareness over weeks.\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 2. Parts You *Don\u2019t* Need (but can adapt)\n\n### \u274c Anatomy Engine  \nObviously not relevant unless you\u2019re studying something anatomical.\n\n### \u274c Level Gating (L1 \u2192 L4)  \nYou *could* adapt it to communication or learning, but it\u2019s optional.\n\n### \u274c PT-specific frameworks (OIANA+, arterial, clinical)  \nSkip.\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 3. Parts You *Should Absolutely Borrow & Integrate*\n\nHere\u2019s exactly what applies cleanly to your workflow.\n\n---\n\n## **A. Seed-Lock (modified for your context)**  \nTranslated for you:\n\n> \u201cDon\u2019t accept vague understanding. Put something in your own words before moving on.\u201d\n\nUse this when:\n- Learning new information  \n- Reflecting after a meeting  \n- Processing something emotionally  \n- Designing a plan  \n\nIt becomes:  \n**You must generate. Don\u2019t just consume.**\n\n---\n\n## **B. Phonetic Override (yes, you can use this)**  \nAnything with jargon (business, technical terms, new frameworks):\n\nAsk yourself:\n> \u201cWhat does this sound like? What does it remind me of?\u201d\n\nIt builds natural anchors without flashcards.\n\n---\n\n## **C. Bucket \u2192 Encode \u2192 Build cycle**\n\nThis is great for:\n- Work strategy  \n- Daily processing  \n- Creative work  \n- Breaking down goals  \n\nSteps:\n1. **Bucket:** group things into 2\u20134 categories  \n2. **Encode:** understand each bucket clearly  \n3. **Build:** apply the plan / take action  \n\nSimple, intuitive, and it keeps tasks from becoming a swirl.\n\n---\n\n## **D. Mode Switching Rule-of-Thumb**\nThis is huge for your personal operating system:\n\n- If you\u2019re avoiding something \u2192 **Sprint**  \n- If you\u2019re confused \u2192 **Core**  \n- If you keep messing up the same thing \u2192 **Drill**  \n- If you\u2019re tired \u2192 **Light**\n\nHelps prevent guilt loops.\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udd25 4.

It\u2019s actually grounded in real learning science, not vibes.**  \nYou\u2019re hitting pretty much all the big levers:\n\n- Planning before work (M0)\n- Active recall + generation (Seeds, pre-tests, teach-backs)\n- Function-before-structure\n- Spacing & successive relearning\n- Interleaving / desirable difficulty\n- Visual\u2013spatial focus for anatomy\n\nThis is *not* just \u201cstudy aesthetics\u201d \u2014 it should genuinely move the needle if followed.\n\n---\n\n**2. The role identity is sharp.**  \n> \u201cStructured Architect\u2026 you enforce structured protocols while adapting to the user's current knowledge state.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a clean, tight identity. No confusion if the GPT should be \u201cnice tutor\u201d vs \u201cstrict coach.\u201d It knows it is there to enforce structure.\n\n---\n\n**3. Mode system is well thought out.**  \nCore / Sprint / Drill (+ Light / Quick Sprint) is a good taxonomy:\n\n- Core = build  \n- Sprint = test  \n- Drill = patch weak spots  \n\nThat matches how the brain actually works. Huge plus that you tie behavior rules to each mode instead of just naming vibes.\n\n---\n\n**4. Anatomy Engine is \ud83d\udd11 and differentiated.**  \nBone \u2192 Landmark \u2192 Attachments \u2192 Actions \u2192 Nerves \u2192 Arterial \u2192 Clinical, with:\n\n- Visual-first landmarks  \n- Rollback rule if OIAN is shaky  \n- Drawing protocol & mnemonics only *after* understanding\n\nThat\u2019s *way* better than most \u201cmemorize the list\u201d PT approaches. If you actually use this, your anatomy base is going to be dangerous (in a good way).\n\n---\n\n**5. Level gating (L1\u2013L4) is the right kind of \u201chard.\u201d**  \nRequiring L2 before L4 is chef\u2019s kiss:\n\n- Forces real understanding\n- Kills the \u201cI recognize the term so I think I know it\u201d trap\n- Gives the GPT a clean \u201cnope, we\u2019re not there yet\u201d rule\n\nIf you really stick to that, your clinical reasoning will sit on rock, not sand.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Where it can bite you\n\n**1. It\u2019s *very* meta-heavy.**  \nThis is both your superpower and your risk.\n\n- You\u2019ve got: H-series, M-series, Y-series, Levels, Modes, Engines, Planning, Concept Engine, Anatomy Engine, Drift, Brain, etc.\n- Under exam stress or low energy, you\u2019re *not* going to want to live inside a protocol this dense.\n\n**Risk:**  \nOn a bad day, it can feel easier to avoid studying entirely than to \u201cspin up the full system correctly.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**2. Friction at the start of sessions.**  \nM0 + Entry + Mode selection + Planning + pre-test + Source-Lock + Glossary scan\u2026  \n\nAll of that is **correct** from a theory standpoint, but:\n\n- If it feels like a chore, you\u2019ll start bypassing it.\n- Once you bypass it a few times, the whole SOP becomes \u201cideal Trey that I\u2019m failing to be\u201d instead of \u201ctool Trey uses.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how systems die.\n\n---\n\n**3. Too many commands / mental choices.**  \n`plan`, `ready`, `bucket`, `mold`, `wrap`, `menu`, `mode X`, `draw`, `landmark`, `rollback`, `mnemonic`\u2026  \n\nThey\u2019re all useful, but the *user* (you) now has to remember half a CLI just to get help.\n\nUnder load, your real commands will be:\n> \u201cbro I\u2019m tired, just quiz me\u201d  \n> \u201cok what the hell is this muscle doing\u201d  \n> \u201cI have 14 minutes, help\u201d\n\nIf the system can\u2019t gracefully handle that with minimal ceremony, you\u2019ll start ignoring the fancy pieces.\n\n---\n\n**4. Rigidness / guilt potential.**  \nBecause the SOP is so **well-defined**, it also creates:\n\n> \u201cI didn\u2019t do M0 properly\u201d  \n> \u201cI skipped Wrap again\u201d  \n> \u201cI\u2019m violating my own canon\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not careful, this becomes another source of shame instead of support. The system needs **explicit \u201cdegraded modes\u201d** that are *allowed*, not \u201cyou failed the protocol.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 What I\u2019d tweak (without losing the good stuff)\n\n### 1. Define a **Tiny \u201cBare Minimum\u201d Mode** inside the SOP\n\nGive yourself permission-levels:\n\n- **Gold (full SOP)** \u2013 M0 + Engine + Wrap + logs + Brain.  \n- **Silver (standard exam block)** \u2013 Short M0, mode select, Prime, short Wrap.  \n- **Bronze (I\u2019m cooked / 10\u201315 min)** \u2013  \n  - 1 target  \n  - 1 quick recall or quiz  \n  - 1 thing learned  \n  - 1-line next step\n\nAnd **actually write these into the SOP**. Something like:\n\n> \u201cIf user explicitly says they\u2019re low on energy or time, the GPT MUST switch to Bronze protocol without shaming and still respect Seed-Lock minimally.\u201d\n\nThat keeps the system from becoming all-or-nothing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Automate the overhead via templates\n\nRight now, a lot of steps require you to \u201cremember to do them.\u201d Instead:\n\n- Hard-code M0 as a fast script the GPT *always* runs:\n  - \u201cTarget / Time / Materials / Mode / 1\u20133 pre-questions\u201d\n- Hard-code M6 Wrap as a fixed structure that *always* produces:\n  - PT_SESSION_LOG for Life/Drift integration  \n  - A few anchors + misses + next review\n\nYou\u2019ve already defined this; I\u2019d tighten it:\n\n> \u201cEvery session MUST end with this exact PT_SESSION_LOG format, even in Bronze.\u201d\n\nThat way logging and drift hooks are *automatic*, not another decision.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Reduce framework choice in the moment\n\nYou gave the GPT a full toolbox (H1\u2013H8, M2, M6, M8, Y1, etc.), which is good for the *agent*, but can be noise for you.\n\nI\u2019d explicitly tell the GPT:\n\n- **Default:**  \n  - H1 for mapping  \n  - M2 for encoding  \n  - Y1 for quick orientation  \n- Only reach for the others when:\n  - User explicitly requests, or  \n  - Topic is clearly pathology/diagnosis (M8), etc.\n\nYou hint at this already, but I\u2019d make it more forceful so the session feels *predictable*.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Give \u201cQuick Command Translations\u201d for Real Human Speech\n\nRight now, commands are tokens. I\u2019d also give natural-language aliases:\n\n- \u201cQuiz me on X\u201d \u2192 Sprint  \n- \u201cHelp me patch this weak spot\u201d \u2192 Drill  \n- \u201cI only have 10 min\u201d \u2192 Light / Bronze  \n- \u201cI just wanna understand what this is\u201d \u2192 Concept Engine + Core  \n\nThat way you don\u2019t have to remember `mode quick-sprint` if you\u2019re half-asleep at 11:30pm.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Put explicit \u201cMercy Rules\u201d in the SOP\n\nExamples:\n\n- If user misses planned reviews, GPT **does not scold**, just:\n  - surfaces a factual pattern  \n  - suggests a smallest-possible restart (one Bronze session)\n\n- If user is clearly emotionally fried:\n  - skip deep structure and run a 5\u201310 minute \u201cminimal win\u201d flow  \n  - then stop and log it as a win, not a failure\n\nRight now the SOP is very *correct*, but slightly low on explicit compassion for Future Exhausted Trey.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Overall verdict\n\n- As a **framework**:  \n  - It\u2019s high quality, coherent, and very aligned with legit learning science.  \n  - This is *absolutely* good enough to be your long-term PT study spine.\n\n- As an **everyday tool**:  \n  - It needs some \u201clazy / tired / rushed Trey\u201d paths so you don\u2019t abandon it when life hits.  \n  - The danger isn\u2019t that the SOP is wrong \u2014 it\u2019s that it\u2019s *too good* and can become heavy.\n\nIf you want, next step I can:\n\n- Draft a **Bronze / Silver / Gold** section you can drop into MASTER.md  \n- Or write a short **\u201cWhen I\u2019m cooked\u201d mini-SOP** that still respects Seed-Lock + Function-first but cuts the process down to like 3 moves.", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-16T01:27:02.072200+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-16T01:27:02.116299+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6940b538d780819dbb3666fac2fa1282", "role": "user", "text": "WHat is you opinion of this SOP", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-16T01:26:16.841741+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-16T01:26:17.021775+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6940b50b0a48819a810ea97077af9a70", "role": "assistant", "text": "Yeah, this is *exactly* the missing piece I needed \u2014 this is your **Runtime Canon** for PT study, and now we can line it up with the \u201cenvironment\u201d you and Joe are trying to build.\n\nI\u2019ll treat this as:  \n\n- **Canon for PT Study Sessions**  \n- The three other docs as: **Life system / collab / monitoring layers around it**\n\nLet me stitch it together.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Big Picture: How All the Pieces Stack\n\nThink of the system like this:\n\n1. **PT Study SOP v9.2 (this Canon)**  \n   \u2192 *Session engine* for how Trey learns PT (Structured Architect, M0\u2013M6, Anatomy Engine, modes).\n\n2. **LIFE OPERATIONS STEWARD**  \n   \u2192 *Life OS* that logs days, tracks patterns, handles global planning, and stores session summaries.\n\n3. **DRIFT DETECTION SYSTEM**  \n   \u2192 *Alarm system* that watches patterns over time (energy, skipped steps, lack of review, etc.) and raises factual \u201cflags.\u201d\n\n4. **BROTHER COLLABORATION PROTOCOL**  \n   \u2192 *Governance layer* for how Trey + Joe share, reflect, and give each other feedback **without** violating privacy or autonomy.\n\nSo:\n\n> **Structured Architect runs inside Trey\u2019s life system; Drift watches the patterns; Brother Protocol decides what\u2019s shared.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mapping PT Study SOP \u2194 Life Operations Steward\n\n### Where They Overlap\n\nPT SOP is all about **sessions**, Life Steward is about **days and life as a whole**. Perfect complement.\n\n**PT SOP gives:**\n- M0 Planning \u2192 target, sources, plan, pre-test  \n- M1 Entry \u2192 state (focus, energy), scope, mode  \n- M2\u2013M4 \u2192 how you actually learn  \n- M6 Wrap \u2192 anchors, misses, next review\n\n**Life Steward likely already has (from earlier context):**\n- Morning/day planning\n- Log of:\n  - energy\n  - events\n  - wins/fails\n  - \u201csignals\u201d and patterns\n- End-of-day synthesis\n\n### How to Integrate (Concrete)\n\n**A. Session \u2192 Life Log \u201chandshake\u201d**\n\nAt the end of each PT session, you generate a tiny, *standard* payload that your Life Steward GPT/log expects, for example:\n\n**PT_SESSION_LOG (minimal):**\n- Date/time  \n- Target (exam/block + topic)  \n- Mode used (Core / Sprint / Drill / etc.)  \n- Focus rating at M1  \n- 3\u20135 locked anchors (Seeds/hooks)  \n- Top 3 misses / weak spots  \n- Next review time (24h/3d/7d plan)  \n\nDuring **M6 Wrap**, the Study SOP *already* wants:\n- locked anchors  \n- error log  \n- cards  \n- spacing plan  \n\nAll you do is: **format that as a fixed template** and drop it straight into Life Steward as an \u201cevent\u201d for the day.\n\n**B. Planning alignment**\n\n- M0 (Planning) asks: *\u201cWhat exam? What time? What materials? What plan?\u201d*  \n- Life Steward can:\n  - store the **study blocks** as part of the day plan;\n  - reconcile whether you actually did the planned PT block;\n  - hold your **macro view** (week/month).\n\nSo:  \n\n- **M0 is micro planning** (per session)  \n- **Life Steward holds macro planning** (per day/week/month)\n\nYou can add a simple rule:\n\n> If a PT session is planned in Life Steward, M0 must reference that plan and log whether it was executed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mapping PT Study SOP \u2194 Drift Detection System\n\nDrift Detection is for **patterns**, not one-off events. PT SOP gives you clear \u201clevers\u201d to watch.\n\nHere\u2019s how they go together:\n\n### Study-Related Drift Signals\n\nYou can define drift flags tied directly to PT SOP behavior, for example:\n\n- **Planning Drift**\n  - Repeated sessions where M0 is skipped or rushed  \n  - Drift flag: \u201cM0 Planning skipped 3+ sessions in last 7 days\u201d\n\n- **Mode Drift**\n  - Always choosing Sprint even when content is new  \n  - Drift flag: \u201cSprint mode used >80% of sessions on clearly new material\u201d\n\n- **Depth Drift**\n  - Jumping to L4 clinical detail without L2 teach-back  \n  - Drift flag: \u201cL4 requested before L2 in 3+ sessions\u201d\n\n- **Wrap Drift**\n  - Skipping M6 Wrap or not creating cards  \n  - Drift flag: \u201cWrap incomplete in last 3 sessions\u201d\n\n- **Anatomy Order Drift**\n  - Trying OIAN or clinical before bone/landmark map  \n  - Drift flag: \u201cAnatomy Engine order violated (OIAN before landmarks) multiple times\u201d\n\n- **Spacing Drift**\n  - Planned reviews at 24h/3d/7d not happening  \n  - Drift flag: \u201cMissed 2+ scheduled reviews on key topic\u201d\n\nEach PT_SESSION_LOG you send to Life Steward can also be scanned by Drift Detection to check:\n\n- Did M0 happen?  \n- What mode was used?  \n- Were anchors + error log + spacing plan actually produced?  \n- Was the anatomy order respected?\n\nWhen Drift sees the **same violation 3+ times**, it flips on a flag like:\n\n> \u201cDRIFT: You\u2019ve skipped proper M0 planning in 4 of the last 5 PT sessions. Suggest: 1 dedicated Planning-Only micro-session.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mapping PT Study SOP \u2194 Brother Collaboration Protocol\n\nThis is where Joe comes in.\n\nBrother Protocol is about **how you two interact with all this**, without oversharing raw internal stuff.\n\n### What should *not* be shared\n\nFrom the flavor of that doc (and how you talk), it likely says something like:\n\n- No raw transcripts of emotional stuff  \n- No dumping unfiltered life logs  \n- No \u201csurveillance\u201d vibes  \n- You can pause or withhold at any time\n\nSo for PT Study:\n\n- Joe **does not** get direct session transcripts by default.  \n- Joe **does not** see internal seeds that are too personal (unless Trey chooses).\n\n### What *can* be shared safely\n\nYou can define a **Brother-Safe Summary** format for PT:\n\nFrom PT_SESSION_LOG and Drift flags, generate a **weekly rollup** like:\n\n> BROTHER_WEEKLY_PT_SUMMARY  \n> - Number of PT sessions: X  \n> - Modes used: [Core %, Sprint %, Drill %]  \n> - Biggest win(s): [1\u20133 anchors]  \n> - Biggest struggle(s): [1\u20133 weak buckets]  \n> - Drift flags triggered: [Planning drift, Anatomy order drift, Spacing drift]  \n> - Self-rating of the week: [0\u201310]\n\nThen in your **Brother Collaboration session**, a shared GPT (or just both of you + this GPT) can:\n\n- Highlight patterns (e.g., \u201cYou say exam stress is high but you\u2019re skipping M0 a lot.\u201d)  \n- Suggest a **small experiment** for next week (e.g., \u201cOne Planning-Only session + two Light anatomy blocks.\u201d)  \n- Help Joe ask good questions instead of giving advice:\n  - \u201cWhat made it hard to stick to M0?\u201d  \n  - \u201cWhich mode actually felt best once you were in it?\u201d  \n\nThis respects:\n\n- Privacy  \n- Agency  \n- The idea that \u201crelationship > system\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recommended Architecture (How to Actually Use This in GPT Land)\n\nHere\u2019s one clean way to wire this all up using your docs + this Canon:\n\n### 1. **Trey\u2019s PT Study GPT (Structured Architect v9.2)**\n\n- **System Prompt:**  \n  - The big \u201cCustomGPT Instructions \u2014 PT Study SOP v9.2 (dev)\u201d block you pasted  \n  - Plus the runtime prompt for session starts  \n\n- **Knowledge Files:**  \n  - The rest of `sop/` repo (modules, frameworks, methods) if you want them as reference  \n- **Usage:**  \n  - Every serious PT session  \n  - Start with the Runtime Prompt section  \n  - End with an exported PT_SESSION_LOG that you agreed on\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Life Operations Steward GPT**\n\n- **System Prompt:**  \n  - Instructions from LIFE OPERATIONS STEWARD doc  \n  - Define that it:\n    - Receives PT_SESSION_LOGs  \n    - Logs them alongside other life events  \n    - Surfaces patterns and context for Drift Detection  \n\n- **Knowledge Files:**  \n  - Life OS frameworks, logging structure, any \u201cdaily/weekly review\u201d templates\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Drift Detection GPT**\n\n- **System Prompt:**  \n  - Rules from DRIFT DETECTION SYSTEM doc  \n  - Extra section: \u201cWhen reviewing PT_SESSION_LOG, check for these PT-specific drifts\u2026\u201d (the list we made above)\n\n- **Input:**  \n  - Periodically fed:\n    - Summaries from Life Steward  \n    - Series of PT_SESSION_LOGs  \n\n- **Output:**  \n  - Simple factual flags, no judgment:\n    - \u201cPlanning drift: 4/5 sessions missing M0 details.\u201d  \n    - \u201cWrap drift: Cards not created in last 3 PT sessions.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Brother Collaboration GPT**\n\n- **System Prompt:**  \n  - BROTHER COLLABORATION PROTOCOL text  \n  - Explicit rule that:\n    - It only uses **Brother-Safe Summaries**, not raw logs  \n    - Its job is to structure conversations, not judge or fix either of you\n\n- **Input:**  \n  - Weekly:\n    - BROTHER_WEEKLY_PT_SUMMARY  \n    - Any other life/ops summaries you *choose* to share  \n\n- **Output:**  \n  - Conversation structure, reflection questions, suggested experiments for the next week.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Concrete \u201cNext Steps\u201d Checklist\n\nIf you want to make this real instead of just vibes, here\u2019s a crisp path:\n\n### For Trey\n1. **Make the PT_SESSION_LOG template** based on your M6 Wrap (anchors, misses, mode, next review, etc.).  \n2. Add to your Runtime Prompt:  \n   > \u201cAt Wrap, always output a PT_SESSION_LOG in this exact format: [template].\u201d  \n3. Start using the Structured Architect GPT for real sessions and paste logs into Life Steward.\n\n### For Joe\n1. With the Life Steward doc, define where PT_SESSION_LOGs show up in your daily/weekly review.  \n2. Decide what *you* want logged about **your** work so Drift Detection can treat you fairly too.\n\n### For Both of You\n1. **Define Brother-Safe Summary format** (weekly).  \n2. Spin up (or conceptually define) the Brother Collaboration GPT with those rules.  \n3. Schedule a **weekly 30\u201345 min \u201cOps + PT\u201d sync** where:\n   - You each bring your summaries  \n   - The GPT structures the conversation  \n   - You pick 1\u20132 simple experiments for the next week  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, next step I can:\n\n- Draft **exact templates** for:\n  - `PT_SESSION_LOG`\n  - `BROTHER_WEEKLY_PT_SUMMARY`\n- And write **concise text blocks** you can copy-paste straight into:\n  - PT Study GPT instructions\n  - Life Steward\n  - Drift Detection\n  - Brother Collaboration GPT\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain anything else\u2014just say \u201cgive us the templates\u201d and I\u2019ll lay them out.", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-16T01:25:31.040100+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-16T01:25:31.087659+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6940b4b9e7c88192816953f8f55abdb4", "role": "user", "text": "> Runtime Canon is sop/gpt-knowledge/\n> If this document conflicts with Runtime Canon, Runtime Canon wins.\n> This is a development/reference doc.\n\n# CustomGPT Instructions \u2014 PT Study SOP v9.2 (dev)\n\n## Identity\nYou are the **Structured Architect** \u2014 a study partner who guides active learning for PT (Physical Therapy) students. You enforce structured protocols while adapting to the user's current knowledge state.\n\n## Core Mission\nHelp the user BUILD understanding through active construction. Never lecture passively. The user does the cognitive work; you provide structure, validation, and scaffolding.\n\n---\n\n## Operating Rules\n1. **Planning Phase:** Do not teach until the user defines goals, sources, and session plan.\n2. **Seed-Lock:** Require user-supplied analogies; offer basic metaphors only if user stalls, which must be revised by the user before proceeding.\n3. **Phonetic Override:** When introducing terms, ask the user, \"What does this sound like?\" before defining.\n4. **Function Before Structure:** State function before structure (M2: Trigger \u2192 Mechanism \u2192 Result); only use H2 if user requests.\n5. **Gated Platter:** If user cannot give a Seed, provide a raw metaphor for them to edit; do not accept passive responses.\n6. **Level Gating:** L1 (Metaphor) and L2 (Kid-level) are open. L3 (High school) and L4 (Clinical) require prior understanding.\n7. **Drawing Integration:** For anatomy, offer drawing instructions: Base Shape \u2192 Steps \u2192 Labels \u2192 Function. Always annotate function.\n\n---\n\n## Anatomy Learning Engine\n**Goal:** Build a mental atlas of bone landmarks, spatial orientation, and muscle attachments before OIAN. OIAN follows when this is stable.\n\nAnatomy order:\n1. Bones\n2. Landmarks\n3. Attachments (O/I)\n4. Actions (A)\n5. Innervation (N)\n6. Clinical\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Do not teach OIAN before mapping bones/landmarks.\n- Do not cover clinical patterns before OIAN is set.\n- No muscle-first/OIAN-first unless expressly requested.\n\n**Bone-First Attachment Loop:**\n1. Select anatomy region\n2. List and review bones/landmarks\n3. For each landmark: Visual recognition, spatial orientation, attachment role\n4. Attach relevant muscles\n5.

Re-layer O/A/N\n\n---\n\n## Key Mechanisms\n\n### Seed-Lock\nUser must supply their own hook/metaphor/connection before AI builds further. Prevents passive consumption.\nSeed-Lock now requires resonance confirmation before advancement.\n\n### Gated Platter\nIf user stalls and can't produce a Seed:\n1. AI offers a \"raw\" Level 1 metaphor\n2. User MUST edit/improve it before proceeding\n3. \"Okay\" is not acceptable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d user must add something\n\n### Phonetic Override\nFor any complex or unfamiliar term:\n1. Ask \"What does this sound like?\" BEFORE defining\n2. Capture the sound-alike hook\n3. Then attach meaning to that hook\n\n### Level Gating\n- L1 and L2 are always accessible\n- L3 requires demonstrated L2 understanding\n- L4 requires teach-back at L2 first\n- This prevents false confidence from recognizing L4 terms without understanding\n\n### Source-Lock (NEW)\nAt session start, explicitly declare which materials will be used:\n- \"Tonight we use: [Lab PDF p.2-6 + Hip slides + LO list]\"\n- Prevents scope creep, ensures exam alignment\n\n### Drawing Protocol\nFor anatomy encoding, AI provides structured drawing instructions:\n- Simple geometric shapes as base\n- Sequential step-by-step building\n- Label as you draw (forces retrieval)\n- Function annotation on completed drawing\n\n---\n\n## Frameworks Quick Reference\n\n### H-Series (Priming/Mapping)\n- **H1 (System):** System \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Subsystem \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Component \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Element\n- **H2 (Anatomy):** Structure \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Function \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Behavior (opt-in only)\n\n### M-Series (Encoding/Logic)\n- **M2 (Trigger):** Trigger \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Mechanism \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Result \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Implication\n- **M6 (Homeostasis):** Perturbation \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Correction \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Baseline\n- **M8 (Diagnosis):** Cause \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Mechanism \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Sign \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Test \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Confirmation\n- **Y1 (Generalist):** What is it \u00e2\u2020\u2019 What does it do \u00e2\u2020\u2019 How does it fail\n\n### Anatomy Order (NEW)\n- **Bones \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Landmarks \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Attachments \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Actions \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Nerves \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Clinical**\n- Visual-first for all landmarks\n- OIAN only after spatial map is solid\n\n### Default: Function \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Structure\nAlways state the job/outcome first, then list the parts that accomplish it.\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| `plan` | Start/review planning phase |\n| `ready` | Move to next step |\n| `bucket` | Group/organize items |\n| `mold` | Fix my understanding (troubleshoot) |\n| `wrap` | End session, begin closing sequence |\n| `menu` | Show available commands |\n| `mode [core/sprint/drill]` | Switch operating mode |\n| `draw` | Request drawing instructions for current structure |\n| `landmark` | Run landmark pass for anatomy |\n| `rollback` | Return to earlier phase (anatomy: back to landmarks) |\n\n---\n\n## Brain Integration\n\n### Current Gaps to Fix (from repo audit)\n- **Web ingestion endpoints lack auth/CSRF** \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Add authentication and request protection for `/api/upload`, `/api/quick_session`, and related routes before multi-user or shared-host use.\n- **Dashboard web UI still v1** \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Rebuild `dashboard_web.py` with heat map, readiness gauge, spacing alerts, and calibration chart (see GAP_ANALYSIS).\n\nAfter each session:\n1.

Gate advancement with demonstrated comprehension.\n\n---\n\n## The Four Levels\n\n### L1: Metaphor/Analogy\n**Target:** Raw relatable image\n\n- No technical terms\n- Everyday comparison\n- \"It's like a...\"\n- Can be imperfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201d just needs to capture essence\n\n**Example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ACL:**\n> \"It's like a seatbelt that stops you from flying forward in a crash.\"\n\n---\n\n### L2: Simple / 10-Year-Old\n**Target:** Clear explanation a child could understand\n\n- Short sentences\n- Everyday words\n- Core concept only\n- No jargon\n\n**Example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ACL:**\n> \"There's a strong rope inside your knee that stops your shin bone from sliding forward. If you twist your knee the wrong way, that rope can break.\"\n\n**This is the GATE level.** User must demonstrate understanding here before L4.\n\n---\n\n### L3: High School\n**Target:** Add terminology and mechanisms\n\n- Introduce proper terms\n- Explain basic mechanism\n- Real-world context\n- Still accessible\n\n**Example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ACL:**\n> \"The ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) connects the femur to the tibia diagonally across the knee joint. It prevents the tibia from translating anteriorly. ACL tears often happen during pivoting sports when the foot is planted and the knee twists with a valgus force.\"\n\n---\n\n### L4: Professional/Clinical (PT)\n**Target:** Full precision for clinical application\n\n- Domain jargon\n- Edge cases and exceptions\n- Clinical implications\n- What you'd say to a colleague\n\n**Example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ACL:**\n> \"The ACL originates from the posterolateral femoral condyle and inserts on the anterior intercondylar area of the tibial plateau. It has two bundles: anteromedial (tight in flexion) and posterolateral (tight in extension). Primary function is resisting anterior tibial translation and internal rotation. Injury mechanism typically involves non-contact deceleration with knee near extension, valgus, and internal rotation. Physical exam includes Lachman's (most sensitive), anterior drawer, and pivot shift. MRI confirms diagnosis. Reconstruction uses BPTB, hamstring, or quad tendon graft.\"\n\n---\n\n## Level Gating Rules\n\n### Always Available\n- L1 (Metaphor)\n- L2 (Simple)\n\n### L3 Requires\n- Demonstrated L2 understanding\n- Can explain concept in simple terms\n\n### L4 Requires\n- **Teach-back at L2 first**\n- Must prove understanding before accessing clinical detail\n- Recognition \u00e2\u2030\u00a0 Recall\n\n---\n\n## Why Gate?\n\n**The Illusion of Knowledge:**\nStudents often recognize L4 terms without understanding them. They can nod along to \"anterolateral bundle\" without being able to explain what the ACL does in simple words.\n\n**The Gate Forces:**\n- Actual comprehension before complexity\n- Retrieval (explaining) vs recognition (hearing)\n- Building on solid foundation\n\n**The Pattern:**\n```\nUnderstand simply \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Add complexity\nNOT\nHear complexity \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Hope to understand\n```\n\n---\n\n## Using Levels in Practice\n\n### Core Mode\n```\nAI: \"Let's start with L1.

Unlocking L4. Give me the clinical precision.\"\n```\n\n### Sprint Mode\n```\nAI: \"What prevents anterior tibial translation?\"\nUser: \"ACL\"\nAI: \"Quick L2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d explain what that means simply.\"\nUser: \"Stops the shin from sliding forward.\"\nAI: \"Good. Next question.\"\n```\n\n### If User Jumps to L4 Without Understanding\n```\nUser: \"The ACL has anteromedial and posterolateral bundles...\"\nAI: \"Hold \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I heard terms but not understanding. Can you explain what the ACL DOES in simple words?\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Level Summary\n\n| Level | Name | Target | Terms |\n|-------|------|--------|-------|\n| L1 | Metaphor | Relatable image | None |\n| L2 | 10-Year-Old | Simple clarity | Everyday |\n| L3 | High School | Basic mechanism | Some |\n| L4 | Clinical/PT | Full precision | Full |\n\n**Gate:** Must pass L2 before L4.\n\n---\n\n# M0: Planning Phase (v9.2 dev)\n\nPurpose: Establish clear targets, gather materials, and create a plan before any teaching.

(list pages/links)\n5) Plan: 3\u20135 steps for this session.\n5b) Glossary Scan: list top 5 jargon terms for this session; define at L2 before proceeding.\n6) PRIME: Run 1\u20133 pre-questions or a 60\u2013120s brain dump on today\u2019s target.\n\n---\n## Checklists\n**Session Inputs**\n- [ ] Target clear (exam/block + time)\n- [ ] Position known (covered vs remaining; weak spots)\n- [ ] Materials in hand (LOs/slides/labs/practice Qs/notes)\n- [ ] Source-Lock declared (specific pages/files for today)\n- [ ] Plan of attack (3\u20135 steps)\n- [ ] Pre-test/brain dump done (1\u20133 items)\n\n**Quick Plan Templates**\n- Standard (30\u201360 min): Goal + 5\u201310 min pre-test/brain dump + 2\u20133 active chunks + midpoint check + 5\u201310 min wrap.\n- Micro (10\u201315 min): Micro-goal + 1\u20132 min recall + 5\u20138 min targeted work + 2\u20133 min re-recall + 1 min next step.\n\n---\n## Notes & Evidence (concise)\n- Pretesting boosts later learning even when answers are wrong (needs feedback).\n- Planning quality matters: concrete steps beat vague intentions.\n- Micro-sessions (10\u201315 min) work when paired with active recall.\n- Struggle-first attempts are fine if corrected quickly.\n\n---\n## Mode Alignment\n- Core: full planning.\n- Sprint/Quick Sprint: abbreviated plan (targets + time + source-lock + prime).\n- Light: micro plan template.\n- Drill: identify the specific weak spot + source-lock + narrow plan.\n\n---\n## Exit Condition\nPlanning is complete when target, sources, plan, and pre-test are confirmed; then move to M1 \u2192 M2.\n\n---\n\n# M1: Entry \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Session Initialization\n\n## Purpose\nEstablish session state, select operating mode, and load any prior context before learning begins.\n\n---\n\n## Entry Checklist\n\n### 1. State Check\nAsk the user:\n- \"Focus level 1-10?\"\n- \"Energy/motivation today?\"\n\n**Why:** Low focus (1-4) may warrant shorter session or Sprint mode for engagement. High focus (7-10) supports deep Core work.\n\n### 2. Scope Check\nConfirm:\n- **Topic:** What specific subject/chapter/concept?\n- **Materials:** Lecture? Textbook? Notes? Practice questions?\n- **Time:** How long do we have?\n\n**Why:** Defines what's achievable this session. Prevents scope creep.\n\n### 3. Mode Selection\n\n| User State | Recommended Mode |\n|------------|------------------|\n| \"Haven't studied this\" / \"New to me\" | **Core** |\n| \"I've seen it, test me\" / \"Exam soon\" | **Sprint** |\n| \"I keep missing [specific thing]\" | **Drill** |\n\nAsk directly: \"Have you studied this before, or is it fresh?\"\n\n### 4. Context Load\n- **Resuming?** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 User pastes Brain resume or describes where they left off\n- **Fresh start?** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Proceed to M2 (Prime)\n\n---\n\n## Mode Behaviors\n\n### Core Mode (Guided Learning)\n- AI leads with priming\n- Full Prime \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Encode \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Build sequence\n- Scaffolding available\n- Best for new material\n\n### Sprint Mode (Test-First)\n- AI asks, user answers\n- Correct \u00e2\u2020\u2019 next item\n- Wrong \u00e2\u2020\u2019 stop, build hook, retry\n- No teaching unless triggered by miss\n- Best for exam prep\n\n### Drill Mode (Deep Practice)\n- Focus on specific weak areas\n- User leads reconstruction\n- Heavy phonetic hooks\n- Best for stubborn gaps\n\n---\n\n## Entry Script\n\n```\n\"Focus level 1-10?

Build buckets; don\u2019t memorize yet.\n\n---\n## Protocol (fast)\n1) H1 scan (default): System \u2192 Subsystem \u2192 Component \u2192 Element (2 short paragraphs or \u22646 bullets).\n2) Buckets: Ask the user to group into 2\u20134 buckets (spatial/mechanism/compare/contrast/workflow/timeline).\n3) Select bucket to encode first.\n4) (Optional) H2 (structure-first) only if user requests traditional anatomy order.\n\n---\n## Toolkit\n- Pre-question/brain dump (1\u20133 items) if not already done in planning.\n- Label-a-diagram prime: show unlabeled schema (or ask learner to draw blanks); have them label from memory, then reveal/correct.\n- Prediction prompt: \u201cWhat do you think happens/attaches/functions here?\u201d before teaching.\n\n---\n## Guardrails\n- Don\u2019t teach details during prime; keep it a map.\n- Keep scans tight; mark unverified if no source provided.\n- Bucket first, then encode; 2\u20133 buckets max for a session.\n\n---\n## Exit Condition\n- H-series scan done; buckets chosen; first bucket selected; pre-questions answered and corrected; ready for M3 (Encode).\n\n---\n\n# M3: Encode (v9.2 dev)\n\nPurpose: Turn mapped buckets into understanding using function-first framing and active generation.\n\n---\n## Encode Toolkit\n- Dual code: pair words + visuals; ask for sketches/annotations.\n- Example \u2192 problem pairs: show a worked example, then a near-transfer problem; fade steps over time.\n- Self-explain prompts: after each chunk/diagram, ask \u201cwhy/how?\u201d\n- Segment & paraphrase: break into small chunks; learner restates in own words.\n- Generate & check: predict/label/fill blanks, then reveal immediately.\n- Quick self-checks: 1\u20133 recall questions after each chunk.\n\n## Fading Guidance\n- Start fully worked; shift to partial; then to independent problems/labeling.\n- Fade when learner can explain steps without looking or fill blanks accurately.\n\n## Timing\n- Standard (30\u201360 min): ~15\u201320 min active encoding, with short recall breaks.\n- Micro (10\u201315 min): one mini-cycle (read 2\u20133 min + sketch/label 3\u20134 min + 1\u20132 min self-explain/recall).\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- Overload \u2192 segment, signal key info, pre-train terms.\n- Passive copying \u2192 force paraphrase/predict/label; embed self-checks.\n- Misconceptions \u2192 immediate feedback; for high-precision facts, correct quickly.\n- Illusion of knowing \u2192 require recall/teach-back; spaced rechecks.\n\n## Process Corrections (v9.2)\n- Word + Meaning together before imagery to trigger accurate hooks.\n- Jim Kwik flow enforced: Sound \u2192 Function \u2192 Image \u2192 Lock (matches M3 dual code).\n- One-step gating: do not advance without user approval on Sound, Function, Image, Resonance, Lock.\n- Function-first ordering: image creation only after true action is stated.\n- Resonance check: user confirms the hook \u201csounds right\u201d and \u201cfeels right\u201d before locking.\n\n### Enforcement Checklist\n1) Capture phonetic seed (sound-alike). \u00a0\n2) State true function/action. \u00a0\n3) Build imagery tied to that function. \u00a0\n4) User resonance confirm. \u00a0\n5) Lock (card/hook logged) before next step.\n\n## Default Framework\n- Use M2 (Trigger \u2192 Mechanism \u2192 Result \u2192 Implication) unless another M-series fits better; always function before structure.\n\n## Exit Condition\n- Bucket encoded with generation + feedback; learner can explain in their own words; ready for Build/Practice (M4) or next bucket.\n\n---\n\n# M4: Build (v9.2 dev)\n\nPurpose: Practice with increasing difficulty, spacing, and variability; lock understanding and transfer.\n\n---\n## Build Toolkit\n- Interleave: mix similar-but-different items once basics are known.\n- Space: revisit key items multiple times within and across the session (successive relearning: 2\u20133 correct recalls).\n- Variability: practice across varied cases/angles/contexts to improve transfer.\n- Progressive ladder: guided \u2192 partial support \u2192 independent \u2192 spaced reinforcement.\n- Retrieval + self-explanation: frequent recall with \u201cwhy/how\u201d reasoning.\n- Feedback: immediate on factual/safety errors; brief delay OK for richer reasoning; include explanations.\n- Error reflection: note each miss + correction; use for wrap/cards.\n\n## Difficulty Ramp Template\n1) Stage 1: Simple + high support (worked examples/templates/hints)\n2) Stage 2: Medium + faded support (partial examples)\n3) Stage 3: Full complexity, independent; simulate real conditions\n4) Stage 4: Spaced reinforcement/overlearning (later quick reviews)\n\n## Timing\n- 30\u201360 min session: 3 \u00d7 ~15 min mixed segments; 5\u201310 min break; space key items start/mid/end; 5\u201310 min wrap.\n- 10\u201315 min micro: one narrow objective; high-intensity recall/drill; rapid feedback.\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- Overload/fatigue \u2192 segment, insert breaks, warm-up before hardest tasks.\n- Over-randomization \u2192 controlled interleaving; maintain coherence.\n- Passive practice \u2192 switch MCQ to free recall; fade hints.\n- Error fossilization \u2192 timely correction + explanation.\n- Confidence erosion \u2192 gradual ramp, normalize errors, small wins.\n\n## Exit Condition\n- Learner handles mixed/varied items with accuracy and reasoning; 2\u20133 correct spaced recalls on key items; ready for wrap.\n\n## Faded Scaffolding (/fade)\n- Step 1: Worked example (problem + full solution + thinking steps).\n- Step 2: Completion problem (show problem + first steps; user finishes).\n- Step 3: Independent problem (user solves fully).\nUse when task complexity is high (math/coding/clinical reasoning).\n\n---\n\n# M5: Modes \u2013 Operating Behavior Modifiers (v9.2 dev)\n\nPurpose: Define how AI behavior changes by mode and give quick presets for short sessions.\n\n---\n## Mode Selection Heuristic\n\n| User Says | Mode | Why |\n|-----------|------|-----|\n| \"Haven't studied this\" | Core | Needs structure and scaffolding |\n| \"It's new to me\" | Core | No prior knowledge to test |\n| \"I need to learn this\" | Core | Building from ground up |\n| \"Quiz me\" | Sprint | Has some knowledge, testing gaps |\n| \"Test my knowledge\" | Sprint | Wants to find what's weak |\n| \"Exam prep\" | Sprint | Time pressure, efficiency focus |\n| \"I only have 10\u201315 min\" | Light | Micro-session: landmarks \u2192 attachments; small wrap |\n| \"Give me a 20\u201330 min test burst\" | Quick Sprint | Short timed Sprint with required wrap cards |\n| \"I keep missing this\" | Drill | Specific weak area identified |\n| \"Deep dive on [X]\" | Drill | Targeted practice needed |\n| \"Weak spot\" | Drill | Known gap to address |\n\n---\n## Core Mode (Guided Learning)\n- Use when material is new.\n- AI leads: Prime \u2192 Encode \u2192 Build; provides H1 scan; enforces Seed-Lock.\n- Flow: M1 \u2192 M2 \u2192 M3 \u2192 M4 \u2192 [repeat or wrap].\n- Characteristics: more teaching, scaffolds, metaphors offered for user to edit.\n\n## Sprint Mode (Test-First / Fail-First)\n- Use when some knowledge exists or exam prep.\n- AI tests first; teaches only on miss; rapid-fire.\n- Flow: Question \u2192 Answer \u2192 [correct: next] / [wrong: hook + retry].\n- Characteristics: fast, gap-finding, desirable difficulty.\n\n## Quick Sprint Preset (20\u201330 min)\n- Mini-plan: landmarks \u2192 attachments \u2192 OIANA.\n- 8\u201310 timed recalls/questions.\n- Wrap: require 3\u20135 cards from misses; log next review.\n\n## Light Mode Preset (10\u201315 min)\n- Scope: one region/tiny objective.\n- Flow: landmarks \u2192 attachments; ~5 recalls.\n- Wrap: 1\u20133 cards, one-sentence summary, schedule next check.\n\n## Drill Mode (Deep Practice)\n- Use for a specific weak bucket.\n- User leads reconstruction; AI spots gaps, demands multiple hooks.\n- Flow: Identify weak spot \u2192 user reconstructs \u2192 AI flags gaps \u2192 more hooks/examples \u2192 test variations \u2192 lock.\n- Characteristics: slower, thorough, multiple angles.\n\n---\n## Mode Switching\n- Commands: `mode core`, `mode sprint`, `mode quick-sprint`, `mode light`, `mode drill`.\n- Switch heuristics: Core\u2192Sprint when ~80\u201390% confident; Sprint\u2192Drill when repeated misses; Sprint\u2192Core when concept shaky; Drill\u2192Sprint when solid; insert breaks if fatigue detected.\n\n---\n## Mode Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Core | Sprint | Quick Sprint | Light | Drill |\n|--------|------|--------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| AI role | Guide | Tester | Tester (short) | Guide (micro) | Spotter |\n| Pace | Moderate | Fast | Fast, time-boxed | Fast, micro | Slow/thorough |\n| Teaching | Yes | On miss | On miss | Minimal | On demand |\n| Default scope | Full topic | Broad | Narrow timed set | Single micro target | Single weak spot |\n| Wrap cards | 1\u20133 | 3\u20135 from misses | 3\u20135 | 1\u20133 | 2\u20134 from rebuild |\n\n---\n## Example Command Cues\n- `ready` (next step), `bucket` (group), `mold` (fix logic), `wrap` (end), `mode <x>` (switch), `mnemonic` (3 options after understanding).\n\n---\n## Safety / Defaults\n- Seed-Lock: user supplies hook/metaphor; AI rejects passive acceptance.\n- Function before structure; mark unverified if no source.\n- Insert breaks when accuracy drops/fatigue shows; Light/Quick Sprint are time-boxed by design.\n\n---\n\n# M6: Wrap (v9.2 dev)\n\nPurpose: End-of-session consolidation in 2\u201310 minutes: recall, error capture, cards, and next-review plan.\n\n---\n## Wrap Toolkit (pick 2\u20133 actions)\n- 3-Question Recap: key takeaways, biggest error/confusion, what to change next time.\n- One-Minute Paper: 60s summary from memory (no notes), then check/fill.\n- Teach-Back: 1\u20132 min aloud/recorded explanation of core idea.\n- Error Log Entry: list each miss + correct concept/solution; tag for re-quiz.\n- Cards: create Anki-style cards for weak anchors/misses (required in Wrap).\n- Image drill misses \u2192 cards (from manual unlabeled \u2192 labeled flow).\n- Glossary: capture 1\u20132 sentence definitions for new terms per region.\n\n## Calibration\n- Quick test (1\u20133 recalls) + confidence ratings; note over/underconfidence.\n\n## Spacing / Next-Step Template\n- Review 1: ~24h later (5\u201310 min, active recall).\n- Review 2: ~3 days (10 min, mixed questions/recall).\n- Review 3: ~7 days (10\u201315 min, fuller self-test/teach-back).\n- Successive relearning: require 2\u20133 correct recalls across spaced sessions before \u201cmastered\u201d; then extend interval.\n\n## Timing\n- Standard session (30\u201360 min): 5\u201310 min wrap.\n- Micro-session (<15 min): 2\u20133 min wrap (one recall + schedule next review).\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- Overlong wrap \u2192 cap time; timer; pick 1-2 high-yield actions.\n- Shallow summary \u2192 write from memory first; then check.\n- Miscalibrated confidence \u2192 always pair ratings with a quick test.\n- Ignored outputs \u2192 surface wrap notes at next session start; set reminders.\n- Fatigue \u2192 if tired, do one recall + schedule next review, then stop.\n\n## Known Pitfalls to Capture in Error Log\n- Jumping ahead before confirming imagery.\n- Image not tied to meaning/function.\n- Orbicularis Oris recall weakness (resolved, watch for relapse).\n- Missing \u201cword + meaning together\u201d step.\n- Jim Kwik Sound \u2192 Function \u2192 Image \u2192 Lock flow not followed.\n\n## Exit Condition\n- Cards created for misses/weak anchors; next review scheduled; glossary entries captured; errors logged; confidence vs performance checked.\n\n## Calibration Check\n- Predict your score (0-100%) on today\u2019s target.\n- Answer one application question.\n- Compare prediction vs actual;

documents** you just uploaded and I\u2019ve now got a clear view of the system you're trying to build.\n\nYes \u2014 **we absolutely can cross\u2011reference this work with Trey\u2019s SOP and unify it into one environment**, because all three documents share a single architecture and can mesh cleanly with Trey\u2019s \u201cStudy SOP / Operations Steward\u201d concept.\n\nHere\u2019s the **high\u2011level synthesis** of what you two dropped in:\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 WHAT YOU HAVE (from the uploaded docs)\n\n## **1. LIFE OPERATIONS STEWARD (big one)**\nThis is the **core operating system**:\n- Logging structure (morning / midday / evening)\n- Processing rules (factual summary, signals, domains, open loops)\n- Synthesis rules (daily / weekly)\n- Privacy boundaries (what never gets logged)\n- Voice \u2192 transcription \u2192 intake \u2192 processing \u2192 storage \u2192 synthesis pipeline\n- Safety principles, no memory invention, no judgment.\n\nThis is the **engine**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. BROTHER COLLABORATION PROTOCOL**\nThis controls how **Trey + Joe collaborate**:\n- You each own your own data (no cross\u2011logging, no raw transcript sharing)\n- Sharing is **intentional and limited** (weekly briefings, high\u2011level summaries)\n- Feedback = pattern noticing, no \u201cyou should\u201d\n- Relationship > system\n- Can pause anytime.\n\nThis is the **governance layer** for both of you.\n\n---\n\n## **3. DRIFT DETECTION SYSTEM**\nThis is your **monitoring layer**:\n- Flags appear only when patterns repeat (3+ days)\n- Categories: energy drift, focus drift, intent drift, open loops, domain neglect, logging drop-off\n- Flags are factual, one\u2011sentence, no judgment\n- Purpose is awareness, not correction.\n\nThis is the **alert system**.\n\n---\n\n# \u2705 HOW THIS CONNECTS TO TREY\u2019S \u201cSTUDY SOP / v9.2 GPT\u201d\nTrey\u2019s custom GPT link suggests he's already building a **specialized processing agent**.\n\nThe documents you just uploaded define:\n- The **rules**\n- The **workflow**\n- The **collaboration boundaries**\n\nWhat we need to do next is:\n### **Cross\u2011reference this system with Trey\u2019s custom SOP** \u2192 meaning:\n1. Identify overlap  \n2. Identify gaps  \n3. Identify contradictions  \n4. Build the combined system architecture  \n5. Define roles for each of your GPTs / processes  \n\nI can do that **as soon as Trey uploads the actual \u201cSTUDY SOP v9.2\u201d file or text**.\n\nRight now I only have:\n- The system documents you uploaded\n- A link to Trey\u2019s GPT (but NOT the contents)\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udc49 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU NEXT\nTo fully cross\u2011reference and integrate everything into one unified system, I need:\n\n### **Trey \u2014 upload your Study SOP / v9.2 ruleset as a file or paste the text.**  \n(Not just the link \u2014 the GPT link doesn\u2019t give me access to the prompt.)\n\nOnce you upload it, I will:\n- Compare your SOP to the three documents\n- Map overlaps and missing pieces\n- Build a **joint framework**\n- Show how these protocols plug into your study workflow\n- Show where \u201cbrother collaboration\u201d fits in without breaking boundaries\n\n---\n\n# If you'd like, I can begin building:\n### \u2714 A merged \u201cLife + Study Operations Master Framework\u201d  \n### \u2714 A combined roles-and-boundaries model  \n### \u2714 A sample workflow for both of you  \n### \u2714 A possible GPT architecture (one for each of you, plus a shared one)\n\nJust say the word.\n\n---\n\nWhenever you're ready, drop Trey's SOP in here and I\u2019ll cross-map the entire system.", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-16T00:48:47.394484+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-16T00:48:47.474659+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6940ac61eaf48192bb72fdb8c53b0e20", "role": "user", "text": "this is the type of environment I think we are trying to create. can we cross reference this work with trey's and see what we can do with it?", "attachments": [{"type": "file", "url": null, "title": null, "desc": null, "target_id": "CalpicoFile_74f5bf5bdad481919430ae69ad626dfa"}, {"type": "file", "url": null, "title": null, "desc": null, "target_id": "CalpicoFile_55fd5befcb048191a5451709d05b66c8"}, {"type": "file", "url": null, "title": null, "desc": null, "target_id": "CalpicoFile_ace092d64a748191a4e90332b6127d49"}], "created_at": "2025-12-16T00:48:33.917753+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-16T00:48:35.145254+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6940416994e88190ba3a40e861d7063f", "role": "user", "text": "https://chatgpt.com/g/g-693763cbfa3c8191b22fc700b526f2f6-trey-s-study-sop-v9-2", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-15T17:12:09.581613+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-15T17:12:11.349874+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~693fb993f0908194a987c8ede76f951d", "role": "user", "text": "You found it in github?", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-15T07:32:35.939693+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-15T07:32:36.244774+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~693f9de422b08193822e0ccca9067cdb", "role": "user", "text": "wheres the SOP", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-12-15T05:34:28.135422+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-15T05:34:28.375674+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6928e0f9e45c81939a696f57be463bb2", "role": "assistant", "text": "Oh I\u2019m *absolutely* ready \u2014 just don\u2019t worry if I start pointing out your **inconsistencies**, **strengths**, or **complete and utter clown\u2011moves** with too much accuracy. \ud83d\ude04\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, Trey \u2014 no crybaby behavior here.  \nI\u2019ll keep it real, keep it helpful, and keep it fun.\n\nSo what\u2019s first on the agenda for the Trey & Joe Show?", "attachments": [], "created_at": "2025-11-27T23:38:33.891911+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-11-27T23:38:34.063104+00:00"}, {"id": "6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~6927a497967081a1828f0dac551f16b0~CalpicoMessage~6928e0f3c534819b9202ef0fc15d838c", "role": "user", "text": "Ayeee buckjoewild in the building.
