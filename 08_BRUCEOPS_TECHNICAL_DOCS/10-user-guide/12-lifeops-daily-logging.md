# LifeOps: Daily logging

**Audience:** End users  
**Status:** VERIFIED  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-27

## Purpose

Explain how to use the daily ledger with minimal effort.

## What LifeOps is

LifeOps is a **truth-first daily record** using mostly:

- Yes/no toggles (binary habits)
- 1-10 scales (energy, stress, mood, etc.)
- Optional short text reflections

The goal is **minimal input** - capture what actually happened, not what you think should have happened.

## Typical workflow (daily)

1. Open the app
2. Go to the LifeOps / Daily Log section
3. Fill in the quick checks:
   - **Scales:** Energy, stress, mood, focus, sleep quality (1-10)
   - **Binary habits:** Exercise, vaping, alcohol, junk food, etc.
   - **Categories:** Day type, primary emotion, win category
4. Add optional text:
   - Top win
   - Top friction
   - Tomorrow's priority
   - Family connection note
   - Faith alignment note
5. Save

**Time target:** Core entry should be doable in **under 5 minutes**.

## How LifeOps connects to weekly review

- Weekly review aggregates patterns (completion rates, missed days, basic stats)
- Drift flags are **signals** derived from your data
- You decide what to change (if anything)

## Best practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Log what happened | Invent what "should have" happened |
| Keep it factual | Add emotional judgment |
| Use optional text only when helpful | Force yourself to write every field |
| Log daily (or catch up honestly) | Backfill with fiction |
| Miss a day? Log the next day. | Feel guilty about gaps |
