# ThinkOps: Ideas pipeline

**Audience:** End users  
**Status:** VERIFIED  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-27

## Purpose

Explain the "idea lane" and how it stays separate from LifeOps.

## What ThinkOps is

ThinkOps is a **contained pipeline** for ideas, drafts, and concepts. The goal is to:

- Capture ideas quickly without losing them
- Prevent ideation from contaminating daily operations
- Track idea status from draft to promotion

## Why separation matters

| Lane | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **LifeOps** | What happened (facts, ledger, truth) |
| **ThinkOps** | What could happen (ideas, speculation, possibility) |

Mixing these leads to:
- Action items getting lost in brainstorms
- Speculation contaminating reality tracking
- Decision fatigue from constant context-switching

## Typical workflow

1. **Capture an idea**
   - Title + short pitch
   - Category (tech, family, faith, income, etc.)
   - Capture mode (quick vs deep)

2. **Assign or update status**
   - Draft → Reality-checked → Promoted (or archived)

3. **Add supporting details** (optional)
   - Audience
   - Pain point
   - Excitement level (1-10)
   - Feasibility level (1-10)
   - Tiny test to validate

4. **Run a reality check** (if AI enabled)
   - AI-assisted analysis of Known / Likely / Speculation
   - Self-deception pattern detection

5. **Decide next actions**
   - Human agency - you decide what to do with the idea
   - AI provides structure, not decisions

## Idea statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **draft** | Initial capture, not yet evaluated |
| **reality-checked** | Has been through AI or manual reality check |
| **promoted** | Actively being pursued |
| **archived** | Kept for reference but not active |

## AI notes

- AI is **optional** - ThinkOps works without it
- When AI is enabled, you can request a "reality check"
- Reality checks classify information as Known / Likely / Speculation
- The AI provides analysis, not recommendations

## Best practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Capture ideas quickly | Overthink during capture |
| Use tiny tests to validate | Jump to full implementation |
| Keep status updated | Let ideas pile up in draft forever |
| Separate ideas from daily logs | Mix ThinkOps with LifeOps |
