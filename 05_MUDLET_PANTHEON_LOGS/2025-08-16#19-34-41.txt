Dretch Street
  The dingy cobbled street is narrow and flanked by looming tenements or
ancient houses, many hollowed out by flame or disrepair.  Spherical
magelights shine day and night atop tall iron poles, illuminating the
perpetual muck that accumulates on the road.  The smell of baking bread
drifts out of the building to the south.

[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
[Hit Return to continue]

been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
