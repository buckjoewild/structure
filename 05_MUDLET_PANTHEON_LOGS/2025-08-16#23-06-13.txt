[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
cultures, and/or aesthetics.  Please see the relevant help files and the
wiki for more information.  

Updates to our in-game help files to accurately represent added skills,
spells, and other mechanical changes are in progress.  In the mean time,
please check out our website or direct any questions to our Discord.  

Thanks for playing with us, we hope you have fun.

<168hp 124m 173mv> 
l cat
An orange tomcat of indeterminate age, his face is plump with
downward-slanted yellow eyes that give him an air of faint but perpetual
misery.  His tail is kinked at the end, and his tattered ear indicates a
rough life as a stray.  In contrast with his grizzled and miserable
appearance, his general behavior is quite affectionate, and he always seems
to be purring happily.

  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

A thin strip of green grass goes down the middle of the street, dotted with
short shrubs.  Each home has a small porch out front with a raised bed of
soil.  Most have chrysanthemums but a few have set up small herb gardens in
the place, or are growing other flowers.  The homes look cheaply made but
are in good repair, all freshly painted and with new, bleach-white oiled
parchment in the windows.  The street looks to have been recently re-paved
with smooth, regular setts and a well-drained gutter.  One of the homes to
the east is open to you.

A Well Lived-In Home
  This small home looks to have been recently renovated it features
somewhat modern ameneties like an indoor hand-pump, glass-encased flames for
lighting, and vents high on the walls that connect to municipal heating.  A
fireplace against the eastern wall connects to a small cast-iron stove a
breadbox sits on the kitchen counter, a butter crock and a tea-tin atop it. 
There are two separate bedrooms on the northern side of the home the walls
seem fairly thin where the home abuts the neighbour's, and throughout the
home it is relatively easy to hear when the people living upstairs thump
around too loudly.  The furniture in general looks relatively inexpensive,
made from cheap plywood, but it seems decently well constructed.  A large
padded mat covered with dog hair takes up a good-sized spot on the floor,
and bowls of food and water are against the wall.  A door to the west leads
onto the front porch and Sald Street.

Sald Street
  Sald Street is a narrow, winding avenue that closely resembles a
forgotten alley.  The broken cobblestones are damp with rainwater,
indicating a malfunctioning drainage system.  The houses in this
neighborhood are wretched, torn-apart things, filthy and barely habitable. 
To the east is the run-down shop known as Ogat's Goods, and to the west
Dretch Street intersects with Sald Street.

northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain

The Center of Arien Plaza
  The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.  

[Exits: north east south west down]
(Translucent) A magic mouth hovers in mid-air, grinning nonchalantly.
The magic mouth tells you, 'Are you sure you're ready to leave the School?'

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

The Beginning of the First Floor
  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
north, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill the
quiet air.

The North Side of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  The hall continues to the east and west.
