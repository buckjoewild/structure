As a result of their extensive training in group-to-group combat, fighters are
highly skilled at landing their blows in such situations. One skilled at reach
mastery will be far less susceptible to failing to reach his enemy in the
fray.

Activation lag  :  1.5 rounds

Syntax: Rout <target>
  
A fighter may use their weapon to attempt to rout an opponent's group. This is
substantially more difficult to do while blind, confused, or affected by slow,
while hasted and charismatic fighters will have an easier time of it. If the
rout is successful, the target's group may be wholly or partially disbanded,
with the chance that those routed might flee entirely from combat; all
members of the fighter's group will also gain an immediate attack on whomever
they are fighting, taking advantage of the confusion.

  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  Surrounded by newly constructed buildings, Commerce Street winds through
the merchant quarter of Var Bandor.  All around are signs of great wealth,
the gold that flows from the prosperous trade evident in the buildings, the
clothing of the citizens, and the meticulous maintenance of the streets. 
Commerce Street runs east and west.  To the north is an open house of some

the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the

northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien

serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate

  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir.

treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

  Tall oaks stretch their great, leafy boughs across a well trodden path
which winds deeper into the valley to the north.  Tangled nettles claw at
the boles of some of the larger oaks, but otherwise little undergrowth
clutters the open forest.  A few small houses can be glimpsed through the
trees to the north.

amongst the trees to the west is a low house of white stone.  The small
dwelling is surrounded by tilled strips of land which sprout all manner of
vegetables.

the forest to the west.  The from here you can see the tops of the trees in
the valley swaying gently in the breeze.  Here and there, a thin stream of
blueish smoke spirals upward from the canopy.  The descending path widens,
and buildings can be seen amongst the trees.  Upward, the path soon
disappears into the forest.

An Open Forest
  Here the ground is flat, and young oak and birch trees form pillared
hallways atop the leaf covered forest floor.  Boulders encrusted with rust
coloured lichen lay about.  Here and there, the stump of a felled tree grips
the earth with dead roots.  A faint path can be seen winding amongst the
trees, leading eastward.  A cool breeze brushes your face, carrying with it
the rich smells of the forest.

  A deep rocky gully comes to an end here, and extends back eastward. 
Sprawling shrubs and bracken overhang this crevice, concealing it from the
forest floor.  The thick overgrowth makes it impossible to climb upwards.  A
cluster of rust-red roots crack through the stone at the bottom of the
gully, seemingly unconnected to the plantlife above.

A Rugged Forest
  As the forest climbs north into the foothills, the land becomes more
broken and rocky.  A faint path scrambles over rising banks of earth and
winds between mossy boulders.  The trees grow densely here.  Ancient bearded
oaks spread their massive limbs above you, while their buttressed roots
twist amongst the boulders and gullies of the broken forest floor.  Here and
there a stray ash stands, grey and solemn.  To the south a faint path
wanders into the Qilarn Forest.  In all other directions a dark forest opens

of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

In the Tables
  The tables are scattered around the room in what seems to be a random
fashion, but there is still ample space for the barmaids to walk through to
set out food and drinks.  A large fireplace dominates the south wall, the
hearth is swept and ready for a warm fire during the winter.  A small
staircase leads upwards in the south-west corner of the room, to the
comfortable beds waiting for a weary customer to rest upon.  East are the
swinging doors leading to the kitchen, and north lies the entrance to the
inn.

This young man sits alone, gazing morosely at the empty tumblers which
litter the table's surface.  It seems that some time ago he chose to forego
the more civilized intermediary of the glass, and now drinks directly from
the whisky bottle.  He wears the fine clothing of a successful merchant,
although looks (and smells) as though he hasn't changed them in days.  
Aldred is in excellent condition.

The Innkeeper's Room
  The innkeeper's room is neat and orderly, and seems almost bare of any
sort of personality.  Apparently, the innkeeper spends most of his time out
in the main part of The Journey's End.  A single bed is pushed into one
corner, the covers folded back, ready for whenever the innkeeper retires for
the night.  A short table stands next to it, completely bare of any sort of
decoration, and a small bookcase is against the opposite wall, but the
shelves are mostly bare.  The only exit is to the west, back to the main
room of The Journey's End.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.
