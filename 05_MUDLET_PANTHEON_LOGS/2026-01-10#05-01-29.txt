In a Fishing Village
  Following the pebble-filled shoreline to the north, the ground here is
alternately covered with pebbles and firmly-packed dirt.  The passing of
hundreds of feet have worn both soil and mud to a smooth finish here, where
only a few errant weeds dare to grow.  A small pier is anchored into the
shore to the north, jutting out into the low-lying shallows of the lake. 
The hard packed ground continues to the east and west, and the center of the
village lies southward.

At the Base of a Small Pier
  Lofted from the ground by a number of heavy rocks and a pair of rusted
metal fastening rods, this small pier provides the fishermen of the town a
launch point for their boats.  A number of metal rasps line the pier,
creating places for boats to be tied when not in use.  The wood of the pier
itself is covered with a thin layer of greenish slime yet is otherwise in
good condition.  The pier continues northward, jutting into the waters of
the lake.  The village itself is to the south, while the shoreline extends
lazily to the east and west.

On a Small Pier
  A small wooden pier is here, lined with metal anchors to which small
fishing boats may be tied.  The wood of the pier is covered with a thin
layer of slime which is marked only by the lines created by the dragging of
filled fishing nets.  A platform which casts the water in perpetual shadow
is about twenty feet above the surface of the water, supported by the wooden
pillars which rise from the water to the east and west.  The platform
continues to the north, while the pier's base is anchored to the ground to
the south.

Below a Wooden Platform
  Surrounded by thick wooden pillars to the east and west, the water here
is quite calm.  Above you is a wooden platform with a few hanging bits of
algae and moss.  The wooden platform appears in relatively good condition in
spite of the plantlife, with very few signs of stress or cracking.  The sky
is visible through the slats of the platform, casting a shimmering pattern
of light and dark on the surface of the water.  A small pier juts out
beneath the platform to the south, while the body of the lake continues to
the north.

the merchant quarter of Var Bandor.  All around are signs of great wealth,
the gold that flows from the prosperous trade evident in the buildings, the
clothing of the citizens, and the meticulous maintenance of the streets.  To
the east is the armory, and to the west is the cartographer's store.

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.
