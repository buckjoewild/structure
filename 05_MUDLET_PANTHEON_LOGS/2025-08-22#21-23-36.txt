The Beginning
  The School of Heroes is hidden in a remote valley in the Yagash
Mountains, and the cold bite of high elevation swirls around you under a
perpetually overcast sky.  Gilded symbols of the gods Dolgrael, Lilune, and
Jolinn have been lovingly sculpted into massive doors of dark basalt that
lock fast behind you.  There is no way back; only forward.  

Whether due to triumph or tragedy, a drive to desperate heroism or sadistic
villainy, you have come to this remote place and secured your adventurer's
license from the School of Heroes.  You have completed your official
training and registration and stand now before the Tower of Testing, where
your final practical examinations await you.  

You may leave through the portals connected to different towns on the
continent of Avendar in the Tower of Testing ahead, but you are encouraged
to proceed with your practical examination, as it will impart many valuable
skills and items for your life ahead.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  A large room of the upper floor of Krilin Fortress has been set aside for
the worship of various deities of light.  The chapel is simply decorated,
with plain wooden pews and a few holy symbols decorating the walls.  At the
west end of the room, a wooden speaking stand has been erected.  To the

a sacred shrine, commissioned by Baron Krilin to show devotion to his patron
deity, Jolinn.  The walls and floor have been tiled with deep blue marble,
with mosaics on either side of the shrine depicting the symbol of the
sapphire spear, and the symbol of the diamond shield.  Set in the center of
the shrine is an altar of blue marble, upon which rests a large book encased

near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately

Syntax: Automatic

A gladiator wielding a weapon (or their own natural claws), when fighting a
severely wounded foe, has a chance to swiftly lop off their head in a showy
display of prowess. Certain powerful mobiles, or those who are particularly
wary will not be able to be decapitated. Naturally, a gladiator who seeks to
show mercy to their opponents will not attempt to remove anyone's heads.

A decapitated corpse obviously cannot have its head trophied.

Druids in sharkform will also benefit from this skill; rather than using a
weapon, they'll use their gigantic shark teeth.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.
