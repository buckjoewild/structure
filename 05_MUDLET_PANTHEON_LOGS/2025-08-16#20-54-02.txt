\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Avendar is a MUD that supports roleplaying, player versus environment
(PvE), and player versus player (PvP) modes of play.  This page will discuss
what that means and what our expectations with regards to behavior are. 
These standards and guidelines apply to players and staff alike. 
Individuals that violate these guidelines will face penalties ranging from
uncomfortable conversations to denial to removal of all privileges and
access to the game entirely.  

Avendar is not a business or a service and we do not have customers.  This
is a hobby which we invite others to enjoy with us in a space we curate. 
Every part of the game will always be free, and no advantage will ever be
offered to a player character for donations given to assist Avendar in its
operation costs.  

The atmosphere we want to cultivate is that of a group of acquaintances
coming together at a person's house to play a tabletop adventure game with a
big roleplaying aspect, such as Pathfinder.  Even as our characters may
engage in conflicts both along and against one another, those should not
[Hit Return to continue]

influence how we treat one another around the table, so to speak.  We don't
have to be best friends, but we expect civility and for people to refrain
from behavior that is malicious, harmful, or unsportsmanlike.  If you aren't
sure whether something is going to be a problem, ask.  If something
genuinely bothers to you, politely bring it up either directly or with a
staff member.  This applies to every space within the locus of our control,
including the Avendar game itself, the official Discord server, and this
wiki.  

We have no interest in developing an exhaustive and specific list of things
you can and cannot do and instead advise you use all of the above as a
guideline.  That said, this is a short list of activities which are
egregiously unacceptable, and will get you immediately denied and/or
banned:

* Any expression of real-world bigotry including but not limited to racism,
misogyny, homophobia, or transphobia
* Pedophilia or explicit child sexual material of any kind
* Explicit depictions or discussions of rape or sexual assault
* Out-of-character stalking, harassment, or bullying, regardless of where it
happens
[Hit Return to continue]

You are hungry.
[Hit Return to continue]


In general, we emphasize remembering that there are real people that will be
reading whatever you write within the game.  As we detail in HELP
ROLEPLAYING, we do not shy away from scenes or stories about difficult
subjects, but we do expect it to be approached in a way that is responsible
and respectful of others.  For more detailed information about what that
entails, please read HELP ROLEPLAYING.  

While PvP is uncommon, whenever you are logged in there is a chance you will
become engaged in PvP with another player which may result in the death of
your character and the theft of that character's items.  Murder and theft
are permitted and encouraged forms of play.  Staff will not intervene in or
adjudicate in-character conflicts between player characters.  We expect
those who engage in PvP to behave in a way that is sportsmanlike and fair;
behaviors such as (but not limited to) timing your log-ins to avoid
retribution or deliberately targeting new players will not be tolerated.  

The game environment including the world and mechanics of Avendar are
provided to you as-is to enjoy and may be incomplete or buggy.  Knowingly
abusing an exploit for any reason will result in all of a player's current
characters being denied and, depending on the severity, being banned from
the game entirely.

All You Knead Bakery
  Two entrances lead into this corner bakery, from Sadrent Road on the west
and Dretch Street to the north.  Many-paned windows on each wall allow
natural light, providing a view of the streets through the bubbled glass.  A
seat is built under the western window, with room for two.  A few brightly
painted tables occupy the space, notably a long magenta table and a round
teal table.  The walls are a soft, inviting yellow and decorated with local
art.  A large counter displays a plethora of baked goods and supports a
heavy, steaming apparatus.  Further in, an oven is kept warm and the bakery
shelves stocked.  A staircase leads up to a private apartment.

<204hp 170m 165mv> Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

| vicious weapons.  Due to their reptilian nature, they are resistant to   |

The Beginning
  The School of Heroes is hidden in a remote valley in the Yagash
Mountains, and the cold bite of high elevation swirls around you under a
perpetually overcast sky.  Gilded symbols of the gods Dolgrael, Lilune, and
Jolinn have been lovingly sculpted into massive doors of dark basalt that
lock fast behind you.  There is no way back; only forward.  

Whether due to triumph or tragedy, a drive to desperate heroism or sadistic
villainy, you have come to this remote place and secured your adventurer's
license from the School of Heroes.  You have completed your official
training and registration and stand now before the Tower of Testing, where
your final practical examinations await you.  

You may leave through the portals connected to different towns on the
continent of Avendar in the Tower of Testing ahead, but you are encouraged
to proceed with your practical examination, as it will impart many valuable
skills and items for your life ahead.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

north, the Dantaron river splits into two forks which flow around Var Bandor
on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows
the outskirts.

  The walls and floor of this cave are slick with moisture and fungus.  The
ceiling dips down at this point, so that a tall man must bend over to
continue.  The cave runs east and west, with a side tunnel branching to the
north.

A Damp Cave
  The damp cave floor is slick with the water dripping from the ceiling and
walls. Fungus and slime molds contribute to the lack of friction underfoot.
The air is stale and musty.  The damp cave twists east and west.

A Damp Cave
  The winding cave splits into a four-way intersection, with one branch
twisting north and the other branches curving west, south, and east.  Water
drips from the ceiling, forming puddles on the cave floor, and the soft
earth that lines the cave floor to the south slowly fades to the north and
west.

The Mining Camp
  This stretch of cave is crowded with mining equipment, bedrolls for
several men, provisions, and various clutter.  Apparently this is the
temporary camp of a mining party.  Further evidence lies in mine shafts sunk
into the east and west walls of the cave, and mine carts partially filled
with ore.  The main cave continues north and south.

The Mouth of the Cave
  A gap in the face of the hill opens into a large cave.  The walls are
slick with condensed moisture and growths of fungus.  There is a musty air
to the natural passage that leads north.  Many footprints mar the soft dirt

A Path to a Hill
  To the north, the path veers sharply toward a cluster of low foothills. 
An opening in the face of the nearest hill leads into a cavern, and to the
south, the lower foothills spread vastly.  Far in the distance, the peaks of
the Brintor Mountains tower above the horizon, a grand spectacle in the

  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir.

central fountain dominates the square to the south.

the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the

center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,

abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the east is Center Square.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

The Bank of Var Bandor
  The most noticeable feature in the Bank is the line of teller windows
along the far wall.  The keen eyes of bankers peer out from behind the
barred windows, scrutinizing their clientele.  Plants and small wooden
benches provide the decor for those waiting for service, and a doorway leads
southwards onto Commerce Street.

Cunning and adaptable, the srryn are one of the most ancient lineages on
Avendar, emerging from the jungles of the Sotuei Cauldron shortly after the
Sundering.  Spreading north, they settled in Vrystet Fen and the swamp
Sythtys, both the kind of marshy, wet environment they prefer.  They are
proud, though the form and justification for that pride changes depending on
the primary god of their sept: Fenthira, Sythrak, or Sitheus.  Their role in
the War of Fire as well as skirmishes with those who enroach upon their
territories have lended them a reputation for decisive brutality, and their
innovative mastery of fire magic is almost unparalleled.  

Sythtys houses the largest contiguous settlement on the continent and is
regarded by nearby human-ruled Earendam as an existential threat.  This and
their past conflicts with humanity have lead to the srryn being marginalized
in places where humanity is abundant.  Despite this prejudice, many srryn
have integrated into multi-species communities, as Fenthira's guiding hand
brings forth their natural curiosity and adaptability.  City srryn can be
found as shopkeepers, porters, guards, and gladiators; village srryn are
often fishermen.  Among the Lsakia, srryn are tenders of their large docile
reptilian cousins known as srorsians.  Srryn have contributed much to the
world's adventuring guilds, bringing their mastery of extreme environments,
innovations in fire magic, and new fighting techniques.  

Srryn are massive cold-blooded humanoid reptiles, coming up to about eight
feet on average.  Their features are distinctly crocodilian, with
vertically-slit eyes, tough scales of nearly any colour and pattern, sharp
claws and teeth, and long tails.  Their tails are not prehensile but they
are quite flexible, being used extensively for balance and communication. 
They have tough claws on both their hands and feet that may be used as
weapons.  Like most reptiles, they are adversely affected by cold, but their
thick scales lend them resistance to fire.  They are large enough to hold a
normally two-handed weapon in one hand.
