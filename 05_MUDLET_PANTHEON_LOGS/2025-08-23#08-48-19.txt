[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
cultures, and/or aesthetics.  Please see the relevant help files and the
wiki for more information.  

Updates to our in-game help files to accurately represent added skills,
spells, and other mechanical changes are in progress.  In the mean time,
please check out our website or direct any questions to our Discord.  

Thanks for playing with us, we hope you have fun.

A Shrine to Jolinn
  An alcove built into the north wall of the Krilin chapel opens to reveal
a sacred shrine, commissioned by Baron Krilin to show devotion to his patron
deity, Jolinn.  The walls and floor have been tiled with deep blue marble,
with mosaics on either side of the shrine depicting the symbol of the
sapphire spear, and the symbol of the diamond shield.  Set in the center of
the shrine is an altar of blue marble, upon which rests a large book encased
in blue leather.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.  

[Exits: north east south west down]
(Translucent) A magic mouth hovers in mid-air, grinning nonchalantly.
The magic mouth tells you, 'Are you sure you're ready to leave the School?'
The magic mouth tells you, 'If you're ready, then you're ready...'

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble

and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded

the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the

The Mining Camp
  This stretch of cave is crowded with mining equipment, bedrolls for
several men, provisions, and various clutter.  Apparently this is the
temporary camp of a mining party.  Further evidence lies in a mine shaft
sunk into the west wall of the cave, and three mine carts partially filled
with ore.  The main cave continues north and south.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

  An ancient temple, this place is built in a magnificent style, calling to

stone steps lead across the south of the room to an altar of deep brown
marble.  Carved above the altar is the lemniscate, traditional symbol of an
ancient order of priests devoted to the forces of balance in the universe.

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens

stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the

The End of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  To the south, a marble stairwell ascends to the fourth
floor, while the hall continues to the north.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell leads upward to the fourth floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The white stones of the third level end at the entrance to this
stairwell, instead replaced by the iconic marble of the School's main level.
The tile floor looks less worn and of a higher sheen, and the stairwell
itself is polished to a high gloss.  Arched windows look out onto the world
at large, high enough to give the faint of heart a bit of pause.  The sounds
of battle ring out from the floor above.  The long hall of the third floor
lies to the north.

the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.

The Northeast Corner of the Fourth Floor
  This floor of the Tower of Testing is done in polished black tile, with
walls of high marble.  The ceiling is vaulted and extravagant, the entire
expanse forming a wide open battle arena.  The tiles of the floor compose a
patterned relief of the iconic sigil of the School of Heroes.  The air is
cool but smells of exertion, blood, and spellcraft.  Lanterns hang from the

NOTE: After this and any death, you will experience some time as a ghost.
In this state, you can interact only minimally with the world or other characters.
However, during this time, you may safely return to your corpse and retrieve the items
you had.  If you know how to reach your corpse, this should be your first course of
action.  If you don't, your items may still return to your recall altar after awhile,
assuming no one has stolen them.

You should seek out a healer, and attempt to resurrect within the next 20 RL minutes
by typing 'heal resurrect'.  If adequate time has transpired since your demise,
you will resume your normal form.  Make sure you resurrect within that time frame
for if you linger in your ghostly form too long, you may find your spirit more apt
to journey away from this plane.  See 'help DEATH' for more.

You have been KILLED!!
You have returned as a ghost, for the moment.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the

The Northeast Corner of the Fourth Floor
  This floor of the Tower of Testing is done in polished black tile, with
walls of high marble.  The ceiling is vaulted and extravagant, the entire
expanse forming a wide open battle arena.  The tiles of the floor compose a
patterned relief of the iconic sigil of the School of Heroes.  The air is
cool but smells of exertion, blood, and spellcraft.  Lanterns hang from the
high ceiling, lighting the chamber at night, while natural light filters in
through arched windows during the day.  The floor continues to the west and
south, while a stairwell to the east leads up to the fifth level.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
north, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill the
quiet air.
