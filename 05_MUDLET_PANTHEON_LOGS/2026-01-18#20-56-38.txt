  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.

  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first

  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  To the east, Arcanos Street winds among the scholars' towers,
and to the west Commerce Street leads to the merchant quarter.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

     A large marble fountain gurgles peacefully here.

The creed of the highwayman is among Avendar's oldest.  These brutish
robbers often scorn elegance or grace, instead favoring swift brutality and
merciless plunder.  Although the precise origin of the craft is unknowable,
it was certainly humans who made it especially famous.  As their race
expanded, so too were resources scarce enough to require violent
reallocation.  The speed of the srryn has left its mark on banditry in
general, their swift claws refining the art of robbery to a razor edge.  So,
too, have the fallen alatharya benefitted greatly from and elaborated upon
its methods, making famous its characteristic brawling moves.  

Bandits are especially proficient in unarmed combat, excelling at both
striking harder and blocking more easily than others.  Despite their skill,
the bandit disregards the trained acrobatics of the assassin and the quick
dagger of the thief.  They are well known for their combinations of attacks
skill with maces.  Of course, the bandit's deadliest tricks happen when
others have been beaten into unconsciousness, be it ambushing, ropes, or
gags.  Even with only rags to his name, a bandit is rarely at a loss while
fighting.  

Law is a concept that has little meaning to a creed founded upon sudden
robbery.  In conjunction with their brutish tempers, bandits rarely have a
place in civilized society except at its fringes.  Bandits have no one deity
they call their own and are given to wandering more than settling.  This
freedom affords them the luxury of taking as they please, from whoever
strikes their fleeting fancy.
