Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

  Arcanos Street is a wide avenue paved with gray stones.  The buildings in
this section of town show an odd architecture, as if they are designed for
purposes other than the usual.  Visible are pyramidic rooftops, domed
towers, and arched entryways.  Controlled by the scholar faction of Var
Bandor, this area is well cared for, with hired servants sweeping the
cobblestones and running errands to and fro.  To the north is an oddly
shaped residence.  West is Ilrin Street.

  This chamber is used by the visiting scholars of spirit for their various
magical experiment and lectures.  The area is charged with magical energy,
and the air tingles as you move through it.  The room has some comfortable
benches and a lectern, but very little else in the way of furnishings.  The
tower continues to the east, and an antechamber is to the north.

  The dominant faction in the tower, the scholars of water who use these
facilities have the lion's share of the resources.  A few beds are here for
the most injured who seek out the scholar's assistance.  Some open scrolls
are on tables, and a few blue robed scholars drift about the room, engrossed
in magical research.  The tower continues to the west, and a stairwell leads

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Activation lag  :  2.0 rounds
Activation cost :  75 mana


Syntax: Cast 'Frozen Shield' <target>

This spell enchants a shield with a frigid chill; this causes it to grant
additional hitroll, damroll, and resistance to fire. When cast upon a blessed
item, the duration will be extended. One may place this spell upon a held
shield by casting it upon oneself. This spell does not coexist with Rotheld's
Bulwark; one may use one or the other, but not both.

Primary Attributes: Intelligence, Charisma

Activation lag  :  1.0 rounds
Activation cost :  30 mana


Syntax: Cast 'Sunset Sigil' <target>

The Sunset sigil bestows a measure of Lielqan's grace upon its target,
allowing them to breathe and move freely underwater, allowing them to defend
and use all combat skills as easily as on land. The sigil wards against the
drown spell, and supercedes water breathing and amphibious breathing.

the most injured who seek out the scholar's assistance.  Some open scrolls
are on tables, and a few blue robed scholars drift about the room, engrossed
in magical research.  The tower continues to the west, and a stairwell leads

this section of town show an odd architecture, as if they are designed for
purposes other than the usual.  Visible are pyramidic rooftops, domed
towers, and arched entryways.  Controlled by the scholar faction of Var
Bandor, this area is well cared for, with hired servants sweeping the
cobblestones and running errands to and fro.  To the north is an oddly
shaped residence.  In the distance to the west is Ilrin Street.  To the

  The interior of this house is crafted of elegant oak, engraved with

house.  A large vase, housing a rare, exotic flowering tree, occupies the
northeast corner of the room, competing with the eccentric, marble furniture
for the most unusual piece decorating the chamber.  A mirror hangs on the
eastern wall, and you glance into it with some trepidation, seeing that it

aroma of lemon drops lingers in the air, giving you the faint impression of
open space.

Erstaphus' Study
  Erstaphus's study is done up in oak and ironwood, with every piece
polished to a fine hue.  A lacquered desk serves to cover most of the south
wall, behind which is a small tapestry.  The center of the room is
relatively clear, to allow access to a series of intricately carved shelves,
which cover the other three walls of the room.  A testament to the tastes of
the room's owner, the shelves house a number of rather unusual artifacts,
ranging from several small statues of unknown beasts to old manuscripts,
rotting from age.  Each entry on the shelves is labelled with a small
plaque, cataloguing the contents.  The only exit from the study is through a
door to the west.

larger than it appears from the outside, disorienting you slightly. 
Flickering flames provide a warm light, although most of the flames just
seem to be floating in mid-air by the walls, not attached to any sort of
source.  Many portraits line the walls, and magical feather dusters fly
about the room, making sure no dust mars the beautiful appearance of the
room, and its many magical toys.  A plush red couch sits against one wall,
and a small table sits in front of it.  On the table, an illusion of a
dancer moves inside a small glass globe.  Inset into the north wall, a
doorway leads into what appears to be a laboratory, and Arcanos lies out the
door to the south.

  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Near a Dilapidated Hut
  The overgrown path to the east and south opens here before a seemingly
abandoned hut.  Originally much like the homes of Jaras Village to the
southwest, this hut seems to have been subjected to a number of floodings. 
Its walls bow out at the bottom, and the wood of the building is stained,
cracking, and mouldering all over.  The area around here looks as if it was
once part of the village but has been overrun with plants for many years.  A
number of reptilian footprints pock the mud, giving it an uneven appearance.
The doorless frame to the east leads into the hut, and a particularly dense
wall of reeds blocks passage to the north.

A Dilapidated Hut
  The walls of this hut are almost entirely rotted through, bowing out near
the bottom.  A narrow window opens to the north, through which a number of
reeds have poked their tassled heads.  Little light filters into the room,
save from the doorframe to the west and a rather large hole in the northeast
corner of the roof.  Water drips from the hole in the roof, keeping the
uneven ground perpetually damp.  Reptilian footprints cover the mud in
small, water-filled craters, and a few body-shaped divots are sunk deep in
the mud in the northwest corner.  A boarded up door blocks passage to the
east.

An Overgrown Path
  The air here is thick and damp, giving a nearly tangible aura of humidity
to the locale.  The dirt here is tightly packed, much like that of the
village to the southwest.  What marks the difference between here and there,
however, is the abundance of tall plants that rise about you.  A few small
paths have been made through the plants, winding toward the north, west, and
south.  Two perilously molded buildings loom eastward, leaving only a small
space to pass between them.

Between Two Dilapidated Huts
  The pathway here appears perilous, for the huts to the north and south
appear highly unstable.  Each building bows out near its bottom, their
mouldering woods burdened by the weight of their hole marked roofs.  Each
wall has an unevenly-cut hole in itself, giving a view to the squalor
within.  The only means of exit from this precarious situation are to the
east, where a grassy knoll rises, and to the west, where your view is
obscured by plantlife.

  The ground rises to a knoll here, the top of which is covered with a
hard, dry, clay.  Relatively short grasses that sway with every breath of
wind grow around and on its crest.  A tree stands at the south end of the

ground dips downward and becomes thickly covered with plants.  A path is

it without creating a large amount of rustling noise.  Standing nearly eight
feet in places, the reeds have become a home to many animals, as can be seen
by the slither marks and small footprints left in the mud, and the sounds
that seem to come from some ambient source.  The reeds thin a little to give
way to brambles eastward, where a few trees loom.  The marsh continues as it

nest at the ground, creating a wide open space that is cradled by plants.  A
few trampled plants surround the nest, evidence of recent activity.  Reeds

foundations sloping into the marsh behind the building.  A few weeds have
broken through the solid-packed dirt and clay ground here, yet the surface
of it remains rather smooth.  The wall of the largest single building in
Jaras village stands tall to the north, its whitewashed finish unique among
the rest of the huts.  An opening leads to the plants behind this home to

north seem to stare longingly at it.  Here, the lack of activity is somewhat
bleak.  A few weeds have burst through the hard-packed mud and clay of the
ground, and the silky fuzz of grass that has sprouted looks like it has been
trampled recently.  The mud and clay give way to a sunken patch of marsh to
the south, while the village continues north, east, and west.

  The center of the lazy village, Jaras Square is by far the most lively
area of town.  Nearly surrounded by houses, this small paved square is home
to a meager wooden fountain which provides the villagers with fresh potable
water.  The shanties that line the square seem to stare at the fountain
blankly, their mildewy facades yawning.  The relatively large building to
the east is the most modern of the buildings, a ragged, poorly carved wooden
leaf hanging above its door.  The pavement of the square hugs closely to the
base of the fountain.  The hard-packed muddy ground of the village continues
to the north, south, and west.

  Surrounded by mud, this plain is slightly sunk from the areas around it. 
As a result, water seeps up through the ground and pools in the random
footprints and depressions left in the mud by passing travellers and
animals.  The ground is sparsely covered with grass, which tufts up from the
drier spots of mud.  An isthmus juts into the lake to the north, while the
muddy marsh rises and continues to the east.  Westward, the ground becomes
significantly higher and drier, while the ground slumps into a pool of

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Swordmasters are warriors who have devoted their lives to mastering one weapon
- the blade.  Learned in ancient meditative techniques, they practice the art
of ak'anginta: "thought-to-form", in which the sword becomes an extension of
self, with each style an expression.  Using these "ginta" or "forms", a
swordmaster becomes one of Avendar's most formidable combatants, displaying a
mastery of his weapon unparalleled by any other.  The roots of ak'anginta are
often claimed by the aelin, its graceful and aesthetically pleasing motions
expressing the highest ideals of their storied culture.  However, over time,
other races have left their mark on the profession's practice, be it in the
cruel precision of the shuddeni or the brutal power of the srryn.

Individual swordmasters often find personal affinity to a single form early
in training.  However, swordplay is as flexible as it is unique, leading many
to take great pride in mastering a variety of styles.  Additionally, the
trained ambidexterity offered by this path allows for greater diversity in
sword selection than other warriors.  Because of their dedication to a single
sword, longer-lived and more broadly experienced swordmasters are able to
vastly outclass swordsmen of other professions.

A deeply aesthetic art, aelin swordmasters of good alignment often favor
Aeolis as a deity, while evil practitioners occasionally offer secret homage
to Serachel.  These affinities can also apply to other races as well,
especially those whose study heightens their appreciation for aelin culture.
However, the path of the ginta is often as deeply individual as its students,
making common swordmasters of all faiths, or none.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Swordmasters, void templars, water templars, and air templars are able to
assume various styles, or "forms", of combat. Each form will provide either a
static effect for as long as the user is in the stance, or activate a specific
effect randomly in combat. Assuming a form requires mana, and each round of
combat that a form is being used requires mana (and sometimes movement) to
maintain that form. If you do not have the mana to pay the cost of the form,
the form will drop. In addition, most forms have a counterform, that will
cause the character to lose his stance, rendering him vulnerable to attack.

Characters must be wielding a sword to assume a form.

Syntax: assume <form name>

The assume command is used by a swordmaster or templar to receive the
benefits from a particular form.  Typically, a form name can be condensed to
a single word.  To drop out of a form entirely, use "assume none".

/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| In the wake of the Sundering, the stately caladaran emerged in the Rirro |
| Jagka and began to tame the wilds there, founding some of the first      |
| formal schools of earth magic.  As a people they are inclined to         |
| scholarship and founded Avendar's longest-lived monastic traditions,     |
| granting them a reputation as wise sages.  Physically the caladaran are  |
| sentient arboreal plants, and are quite tall with skin that resembles    |
| tree bark in hue and consistency and keratinous foliage that can         |
| resemble that of any tree species.  They age very slowly and live much   |
| longer than any other sapient species.  They also regenerate more slowly |
| than others, but regain mana more quickly.  For more information. read   |

The Beginning
  The School of Heroes is hidden in a remote valley in the Yagash
Mountains, and the cold bite of high elevation swirls around you under a
perpetually overcast sky.  Gilded symbols of the gods Dolgrael, Lilune, and
Jolinn have been lovingly sculpted into massive doors of dark basalt that
lock fast behind you.  There is no way back; only forward.  

Whether due to triumph or tragedy, a drive to desperate heroism or sadistic
villainy, you have come to this remote place and secured your adventurer's
license from the School of Heroes.  You have completed your official
training and registration and stand now before the Tower of Testing, where
your final practical examinations await you.  

You may leave through the portals connected to different towns on the
continent of Avendar in the Tower of Testing ahead, but you are encouraged
to proceed with your practical examination, as it will impart many valuable
skills and items for your life ahead.

[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
[Hit Return to continue]

been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
[Hit Return to continue]

cultures, and/or aesthetics.  Please see the relevant help files and the
wiki for more information.  

Updates to our in-game help files to accurately represent added skills,
spells, and other mechanical changes are in progress.  In the mean time,
please check out our website or direct any questions to our Discord.  

Thanks for playing with us, we hope you have fun.

  Past the wrought iron gates is a wide corridor with walls cut from solid
granite blocks, lit by mounted white globes.  The entry corridor is
surprisingly simple for such a vast and well-known establishment, as it
bears no notable ornamentation.  The School's foyer awaits to the north,
opening up from the corridor's enclosure into a vast chamber.  To the south

The Foyer of the School of Heroes
  The School of Heroes begins with a grand foyer, complete with a vaulted
ceiling held aloft by great marble columns.  The room is spacious and airy,
with high, white marble walls and mounted, shining globes to provide light. 
Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.  

A large sign sits off to one side, offering directions to students.

Jimacha tells you, 'Veljik, my name is Jimacha.  May the gods bless you with reason.'

Jimacha tells you, 'You should explore its sections thoroughly before you proceed to the Tower of
Testing.'
Jimacha tells you, 'Make sure you are armed and proceed with caution-- the Tower is full of
monsters!'
Jimacha tells you, 'If you ascend it successfully, you will be rewarded with the School sigil.'

The Beginning of the Hall of Professions
  The Hall of Professions is the part of the School of Heroes dedicated to
the training of adventurers in their respective guilds.  Since many of the
skills taught here are rudimentary, many of Avendar's individual guilds are
not represented; instead, a broader professional trainer serves each
respective classification.  The floor and walls are made from granite,
giving the hallway itself a cool, clean feel.  To the east is a fighting pit
where young warriors train, while to the west, a well-supplied classroom
lends itself to the instruction of rudimentary scholars.  The Hall of
Professions continues to the north, while the School's foyer is to the
south.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is

The Nymph's Tears
  This tavern looks a higher class than most buildings around this area,
being clean and well kept.  The bar on the east wall is dark polished oak,
the warm gleam unmarred by scratches or scars.  Rows of clean, sparkling
glasses are set above the bar, waiting to be filled with one of the exotic
imported drinks, or some dark, frothy ale.  West is a small stage, and some
sturdy tables for the patrons to rest their drinks on, as they sit and watch
the show.  North is the door back to Aragol Street, a faint fishy odour
wafting in to mingle with the sweet scents of liquor.

  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

The Outskirts of Var Bandor
  You stand outside the north wall of Var Bandor.  In the distance to the
north, the Dantaron river splits into two forks which flow around Var Bandor
on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows
the outskirts.

A Ferry Station
  The waters of the Dantaron River flow placidly to the north, a muddy
brown barrier to merchants, carts, and foot travelers.  A small wooden dock
has been erected at the water's edge, and several large ferries run by
riverfolk carry passengers back and forth between the Arien Road and the
outskirts of Var Bandor.

The Dantaron River
  The winding Dantaron River turns to the east, flowing by the city of Var
Bandor.  The placid, muddy waters ripple gently as they run their course,
eventually leading to Earendam eastward.  The stone walls of Var Bandor
tower menacingly to the south, and north and south of the river ferry
stations have been set up.

The caladaran are reknowned throughout Avendar for their wisdom.  Tall,
gentle creatures with odd bark-like skin, they tend to live either in
forests or among the mountains, where they are known for their secluded
lifestyles. Recently, however, many Caladaran have been known to descend
into the towns, mixing with civilization and crowds. Few in number, the
Caladaran are long-lived and reknowned for their skills as sages, refusing
direct physical confrontation.

Due to this tendency to avoid physical violence and to seek a more spiritual
mode of existence, caladaran tend to regain health less rapidly than other
races. However, this passive mode of existence allows more time for
meditation, allowing mental energy to be regained more rapidly.
    
Caladaran may be good or neutral, and may not be chaotic in nature. They may
become bards, druids, psionicists, and scholars.

Caladaran receive 4 practices per level.

Devoting so much of their life to the usage of the blade, swordmasters grow
adept with any sword they put their hand on. Even a poorly-crafted blade will
strike more fiercely in the hands of someone with this skill, causing direct
improvements to a sword's average damage. This will not be sufficient to
replace a true master's favoured weapon, or a sword meant to kill legends, but
it might help with attaining such a blade. Additionally, with this skill, a
swordmaster has a significantly reduced chance of causing damage to their
weapons through combat.

Finally, with this skill, at any point when damroll would be checked for melee
combat (including via forms or skills), hitroll will be used in its place.
This effect scales to the user's level, and sees sharply diminishing returns
above sixty hitroll.

A Hidden Cave
  A door hidden in a smooth section of the cliff face swings open silently,

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.
