<459hp 398m 254mv> Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

The Wheelwright's
  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.  

[Exits: north]
     A huge, wooden wheel is here lying broken on the ground.
Terintbanch is here bending pieces of metal and wood to his will.
Terintbanch Plun says, 'Greetings, Sir.'
