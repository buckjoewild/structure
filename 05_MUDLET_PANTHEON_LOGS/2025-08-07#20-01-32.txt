The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

Center of Tyril Square
  The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

East of Tyril Square
  The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way begins here, serving as a throughway for the scholars
and craftsman who travel to and from Tyril Square to the west and the
artisan's district of Earendam further east.  To the south of the street,
marble stairs lead up to enter some sort of scholar's shop, while the
building to the north is less ostentatious, being a simple stone block
guarded by gate archways.  Home to the Company of the Ram, the building
houses one of Earendam's chartered mercenary companies.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Frequented by the city's craftsmen, the street serves
to connect the Glallian School to the east with Tyril Square which lies
further west down the street.  A small side street leads north, and a stone
wall prevents further travel southward.

Vandar's Blades
  Vandar's Blades is a well-furnished shop, offering the wares created by
the craftsman who inhabit the artisan's district of Earendam.  With no forge
in evidence, the shop is remarkably comfortable, offering a wide variety of
weapons on display on the walls behind the counter that takes up the north
half of the room.  The wall to the east is rather thin, and is broken by a
pine door.  A doorway also leads southward onto Frinian Way, which runs in

Elrith's Armory
  Elrith's Armory specializes in the fine plate armors produced by the
artisans and earth scholars of Earendam, providing wares for the cities
wealthier nobility.  With most of the merchandise furnished by the artisans
in the surrounding parts of the city, the shop lacks the forge common in
most such places.  The north part of the room is taken up with a counter,
beside which a full set of field plate is arranged on a pole.  A pine door
leads through a wall to the west, and the way onto the street lies south.

Heading north away from the course of the Dantaron, Glallia passes by the
building which is its namesake to the east.  Towering over the street, the
Glallian School is an exercise in the classical Republican style.  A paegant
of marble columns and arches, the building nevertheless seems shaped out of
a single stone from the Brintor mountainside.  Marble stairs lead up to an

towards the entrance.  Made from the sturdy stone of the Brintors, the steps
show no signs of chisel mark or hammer strike.  The massive block of the
stairs turns to the south, and ascends to the east.

Landing near the Glallian School
  This landing provides entrance to the main part of the Glallian School,
directly east of here.  The school is both grandiose and extravagant as a
study in Earendam's classical Republican style.  Multi-levelled and
intricately carved with bas reliefs and statuery, the school's varying parts
compete to gain the attention of the observer.  Supporting the building are
a series of marble columns, framing a series of archways which lead eastward
into the building.  The building shows no signs of breaks or seams in its
constituent marble, and the entire structure seems molded, rather than
chiselled.  Stairs lead down to the west, and the landing continues to the
north, and bends to the south.

Intersection of Glallia Street and Frinian Way
  Glallia Street heads north and south through the heart of Earendam's
artisan's district, where it intersects East Frinian Way to the west. 
Heading north away from the course of the Dantaron, Glallia passes by the
building which is its namesake to the east.  Towering over the street, the
Glallian School is an exercise in the classical Republican style.  A paegant
of marble columns and arches, the building nevertheless seems shaped out of
a single stone from the Brintor mountainside.  Marble stairs lead up to an
entrance to the school to the east, and Glallia comes to an end to the
north.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Lining the street are shops bearing the products of the
craftsmen who work in this part of the city.  To the south is a jeweller's
shop, which is successful enough to have a plate glass window to display its
wares.  The armorer's shop to the north has no such trappings, but
nevertheless bears the symbols of its wares on a stout wooden sign.  Frinian
comes to an end to the east, but continues along its current path to the
west.

to connect the Glallian School to the east with Tyril Square which lies
further west down the street.  A small side street leads north, and a stone
wall prevents further travel southward.

  East Frinian Way begins here, serving as a throughway for the scholars

artisan's district of Earendam further east.  To the south of the street,
marble stairs lead up to enter some sort of scholar's shop, while the
building to the north is less ostentatious, being a simple stone block
guarded by gate archways.  Home to the Company of the Ram, the building
houses one of Earendam's chartered mercenary companies.

  The entrance hall to the Company of the Ram is a well-tended place, with
a martial aura about it.  The brick walls and floors of the place are free
of the typical dust and rubbish of a fighting company, with even the
masonry's cracks and nicks kept mended.  Arched portcullises lead east and
west, and the street lies through a southern entranceway.  North of the

  The northeast corner of Tyril Square is formed by the intersection of

Covered with a cobblestone of glazed brown bricks, the square stretches off
south and west, heading toward the north gates of town to the west, and a
central fountain to the southwest.  The occasional armed patrol lingers
around an arched portcullis to the east, usually coming from or going to the
north gates of the town.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

The Dantaron River
  The winding Dantaron River turns to the east, flowing by the city of Var
Bandor.  The placid, muddy waters ripple gently as they run their course,
eventually leading to Earendam eastward.  The stone walls of Var Bandor
tower menacingly to the south, and north and south of the river ferry
stations have been set up.

A Ferry Station
  The waters of the Dantaron River flow placidly to the north, a muddy
brown barrier to merchants, carts, and foot travelers.  A small wooden dock
has been erected at the water's edge, and several large ferries run by
riverfolk carry passengers back and forth between the Arien Road and the

The Outskirts of Var Bandor
  You stand outside the north wall of Var Bandor.  In the distance to the
north, the Dantaron river splits into two forks which flow around Var Bandor
on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows
the outskirts.

Outside the Northern Gatehouse
  The towering gates of Var Bandor rise to the south.  Huge, heavy wooden
doors reinforced with iron bars, the gates are maintained rigorously.  The
walls to the east and west are solid stone, with murder slits.  To the
north, the river Dantaron splits into two mighty forks which flow by Var
Bandor on either side.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.
