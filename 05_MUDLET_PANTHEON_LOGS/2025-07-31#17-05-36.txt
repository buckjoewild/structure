The Western Arien Plaza
  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

  The northwestern corner of the Arien Plaza bustles with activity as it
approaches the city walls of Earendam to the west.  Travelers and merchants
wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of
Earendam to the south.  The edge of the plaza lines a row of shops to the
east, but comes to an end here, where a large inn sits in the crook between
the city wall and the shops to the east, and is marked by the sign of a
flagon and bedroll.

Anteroom of the Arien Way
  This small hallway serves as the anteroom for the Arien Way, a popular
tavern in this part of Earendam.  Covered in panelled pine, the walls of the
hallway narrow in a doorway to the north, leading to the interior of the
tavern.  Covering the floor of the anteroom is a tiled mosaic, depicting the
traditional sign of a tavern, made using colored stones from the Brintors.

which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut

Andralis is a rather handsome aelin, with features marking him as a
nobleman of one of Ilodaiya's houses.  Marked with harsh lines, his face
seems aged by the discipline of a soldier's life, but his eyes tell a
different tale.  With a merry smile, he occasionally greetings a passing
pattern, or runs his hand lovingly over the grain of the wooden table at
which he sits.  
Andralis is in excellent condition.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues
north and east, and meets the bar west of here.

tavern in this part of Earendam.  Covered in panelled pine, the walls of the

travelers heading east here tend to be artisans or scholars of one form or

The Center of Arien Plaza
  The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Reed'

In the form of the reed, the swordmaster focuses all of abilities on using
his weapon to beat back his opponents attack.  Bending like a reed in the
wind, his ability to both parry and offhand parry is doubled.  However, this
level of focus means that he is then unable to attempt second, third, or
fourth attacks, and will lower the amount of damage dealt by a meditative
strike.

Syntax: Automatic

Bladed weapons with a typically short haft, axes are most often favoured by
barbarians, who enjoy their lack of subtlety and learn specific techniques for
them. Axes may be found in many sizes, for both one and two-handed use. They
typically deal slashing damage, and they are characteristically poor at
fending off blows, due to their balance and lack of finesse. The weighty
swings often required by axes make it suited against both shield blocking and
deflection, but much easier for opponents to fend off or stone phalanx.

west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues
north and east, and meets the bar west of here.

wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of
Earendam to the south.  The edge of the plaza lines a row of shops to the

the city wall and the shops to the east, and is marked by the sign of a

Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir.

The West Gate of Earendam
  Earendam's west gates are made of sturdy iron, built between two tall
stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.
