The Middle of the Savannah

The grass of the savannah is thick and lush, but remains passable.  Small
rocks and bushes are interspersed amidst the grass and an occasional tree
dots the landscape, providing meager shelter.  Far off in the distance to
the northwest the peak of Mount Enrien is distinguishable rising into the
clouds, while the shore of a lake is visible to the southeast.

road passes through the savannah, while to the northeast the peak of Mount

  The footprints of deer and other smaller animals mark this trail.  The
trail itself is thin, the tall Nendorin oaks encroaching upon the well worn
path.  The foilage blocks out most of the light, making the trail dim.  The
trail itself leads north west.  Through the trees to the east you can make
out another path winding through the forest.  Southwards, the forest grows

The Forest Path
  A thin but well worn path winds through the forest of Nendor.  Stones
inscribed with odd runic markings dot the side of the path every now and
again, standing on the border between road and forest.  Large oaks line the
path on either side, leaves casting shade upon the path below.  The singing
of birds echoes through the forest, providing a constant murmur of sound.  The
path runs north and south through the forest, and a break in the trees about
you is visible to the east.

  The southern gatehouse of Var Bandor is an elaborate affair,
well-maintained and proper.  A close watch is kept on the kind of traveler
allowed to enter the finest districts of the city, and a roster of those
banned from the area is kept nearby.  The immense granite walls rise to
either side of the gates, and to the south, the outskirts of Var Bandor run
into a thickly wooded area.  North, Ilrin Street leads into the heart of the
city.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

The oldest of Avendar's warrior creeds, the barbarian has been a fixture of 
the wild since the earliest ages of man. The first of the fallen alatharya 
shamans were eager to call upon their strength and fury in times of need; the 
the feral kankoran, the brutal srryn, and young humanity would all seek power 
through similar means. The terrifying vision of the horde which broke the 
Republic is never far from cityfolk who encounter the modern barbarian, 
ensuring that their guilds are never exulted in civilized city-states. 
  
The barbarian's methods are as crude and harsh as the ancient world which 
shaped him; the axe, the mace, and the wilderness are his steadfast 
companions. He is most well-known for his mighty hews, which have broken the 
bodies of adventurer and creature alike. His skill with the mace allow him to 
shatter bone or daze his foes, striking fear into the hearts of spellcasters 
who might oppose him. He can create simple, ad-hoc weapons and necessities in 
forests. Finally, he can feast upon the flesh of the defeated, and craft 
clothing from their hides. 
  
Barbarians may be of any alignment, but due to their wild, roaming natures, 
they may never be lawful. Kankoran deities are the primary patrons of those 
who wish to destroy the cities of men, and thus many barbarians find value in 
their creeds. Enirra and Dolgrael are often popular amongst humans and 
alatharya, while srryn are near-universally heed the call of Sythrak. However, 
barbarians are as diverse and free-natured as the great beasts who roam 
Avendar's vast wilderness, leading many to serve only their own personal 
whims.

  Surrounded by newly constructed buildings, Commerce Street winds through
the merchant quarter of Var Bandor.  All around are signs of great wealth,
the gold that flows from the prosperous trade evident in the buildings, the
clothing of the citizens, and the meticulous maintenance of the streets.  To
the east is a fine weapon store, and to the west is a gem shop.

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  To the east, Arcanos Street winds among the scholars' towers,
and to the west Commerce Street leads to the merchant quarter.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.
