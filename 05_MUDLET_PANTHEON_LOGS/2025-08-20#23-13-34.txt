\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

First rising to prominence during the War of Night, Void templars are a fusion
of both dark magics and martial force.  Because of its shuddeni roots, they
are the primary dedicants of this profession.  However, it also has a
substantial following amongst the aelin, forming the origin of its famously
diabolic ginta.  The srryn devotees of the god Sitheus too have formed a sept
partially devoted to seeking the Void's demonic power.

Although learned in several powerful defensive techniques, Void templars are
primarily offensive in nature. They study numerous means of debilitating their
foes, both via weapon and spell.  Alone among templars, they eschew knowledge
of the spear, choosing instead to focus their efforts on the sword and shield.
Despite this focus, it is not uncommon to see a Void templar occasionally
employ a whip.

The Void is a power of law and evil, and cannot be manipulated by any who are
of chaotic or good mindset. Srryn templars of the Void often nominally follow
Sitheus under the aegis of the Thissa Sept, and some cleave to other dark
gods, but many Void templars do not honour any specific god, seeking instead
to serve only their own power through pain.

The Western Arien Plaza
  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

  The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

One of the first professions to arise in history as people became more
civilized, many races lay claim to the original thieves. It is likely that
there is no real answer to the question; the earliest srryn were just as
inclined to be picking pockets amongst their huts as the aelin swindled each
other in the shadows of their growing cities. The nefortu, ever fond of their
tricks, as well took to this work as they emerged, and the shuddeni too enjoy
such exploitation of others. Even the ch'taren have taken to these roguish
practices, using them to subtly work a greater good upon the world.

Above all other weapons, thieves specialize in daggers, using them to slice
and stab at foes, often inflicting unparalleled amounts of damage with them.
They do also learn to use swords, and occasionally utilize whips as well; the
former to better defend themselves. Most thieves learn swiftly the benefit of
rapidly shifting their weapons about. Thieves have also developed their own
method of communication through complex hand gestures, known as cant.

Coming from all walks of life, thieves may be of any alignment and may follow
any god or none; even Iandir and Jolinn have welcomed the faith of thieves
who apply their copious talents in appropriate ways. Among aelin theives,
Serachel is often the source of many a swift prayer, as his dominance over
shadows places much of their work under his aegis.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

The oldest of Avendar's warrior creeds, the barbarian has been a fixture of 
the wild since the earliest ages of man. The first of the fallen alatharya 
shamans were eager to call upon their strength and fury in times of need; the 
the feral kankoran, the brutal srryn, and young humanity would all seek power 
through similar means. The terrifying vision of the horde which broke the 
Republic is never far from cityfolk who encounter the modern barbarian, 
ensuring that their guilds are never exulted in civilized city-states. 
  
The barbarian's methods are as crude and harsh as the ancient world which 
shaped him; the axe, the mace, and the wilderness are his steadfast 
companions. He is most well-known for his mighty hews, which have broken the 
bodies of adventurer and creature alike. His skill with the mace allow him to 
shatter bone or daze his foes, striking fear into the hearts of spellcasters 
who might oppose him. He can create simple, ad-hoc weapons and necessities in 
forests. Finally, he can feast upon the flesh of the defeated, and craft 
clothing from their hides. 
  
Barbarians may be of any alignment, but due to their wild, roaming natures, 
they may never be lawful. Kankoran deities are the primary patrons of those 
who wish to destroy the cities of men, and thus many barbarians find value in 
their creeds. Enirra and Dolgrael are often popular amongst humans and 
alatharya, while srryn are near-universally heed the call of Sythrak. However, 
barbarians are as diverse and free-natured as the great beasts who roam 
Avendar's vast wilderness, leading many to serve only their own personal 
whims.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Trained for the arena-fighting that is common throughout Avendar, gladiators
transform the gruesome structure into a spectacle of showmanship.  Arising
from the slave culture of Ashta Harrud, gladiatorial combat grew in popularity
as word spread along northern trade routes.  With the emergence of the
shuddeni into the racial mix of Avendar, gladiatorial bouts have become both
more humane and less.  Cities such as Earendam the Grand have outlawed the use
of slaves and brought a measure of self-determination to the practice.
Meanwhile, its brutality has simultaneously increased with the growing number
of chaja and introduction of overworlders into the high-risk arenas of
Yithoul.

It is common for srryn to come north from their native swamps to ply their
bloodthirst in Earendam, the potential rewards outweighing the indignities of
competing against (and for the entertainment of) warmbloods.  Harrudim
gladiators are nearly exclusively human, whereas the shuddeni favor making
their chaja subordinates fight for pleasure.  The massive size of the
alatharya frequently make them a fan-favorite, their racial proclivity for
both resilience and force giving them notable advantages.  Kankoran often
train as gladiators, although the radical fringe of pack society may shun them
for embracing this product of highly civilized life.

Dolgrael is a favored deity among gladiators, as their lifestyle puts them
frequently against the odds in battle.  The arena calls to no one faith or
alignment, and gladiators often pray to whatever god they feel most likely to
grant them victory.  However, such prayers are a privilege paid for in blood.

Gladiators are trained in a variety of weapons, as well as techniques to put
them to good use-- a lesson hard-learned from the restrictions of the arena.
The spear, the sword, the whip, and the flail are often weapons of choice for
a skilled gladiator, as each carries unique, tactical advantages.

  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The Center of Arien Plaza
  The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

A Thickly Wooded Forest
  Thick undergrowth packed between dense trees makes movement through this
part of the forest difficult, and in some places impossible.  Bits of light
finding their way through the verdant foliage provide adequate illumination
and allow the growth of the brambles and weeds that spread around the trees.
The forest continues all about you, too dense for passage in some places. 
Southwards, the trees seem more crooked than is usual, branches and trunks
twisting.  A faint breeze carries the smell of decay to your nostrils.  No
footprints or animal tracks whatsoever lead to the south...  It seems as
though all life forms shun the area.

  Spreading out over the land, the savannah continues in every direction. 
The grass of the savannah is thick and lush, but remains passable.  Small
rocks and bushes are interspersed amidst the grass, and an occasional tree
dots the landscape, providing meager shelter.  In the distance to the

towering over the hills which surround it, while a large building sits at
the edge of a wide road to the southwest.

here, preventing access to the north and east.  The grass of the savannah is
thick and lush, but remains passable.  The peak of Mount Enrien rises into
the clouds off to the northwest, while the savannah continues to the west
and south.  

[Exits: south west]
A pale green snake slithers through the grass.

The peak of Mount Enrien rises into the clouds to the northwest, while the
savannah continues to the east, west, and south.

The Middle of the Savannah
  Spreading out over the land, the savannah continues in every direction. 
The grass of the savannah is thick and lush, but remains passable.  Small
rocks and bushes are interspersed amidst the grass, and an occasional tree
dots the landscape, providing meager shelter.  In the distance to the
northwest the peak of Mount Enrien is visible rising into the clouds,
towering over the hills which surround it, but no other landmarks are
visible.
