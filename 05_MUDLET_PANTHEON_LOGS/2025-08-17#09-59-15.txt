\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Human:     Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.      |
| Aelin:     Slight with feathered wings, known for their grace and pride. |
| Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.  |
| Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions. |
| Chaja:     Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns. |
| Ch'taren:  Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.       |
| Ethron:    Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.    |
| Nefortu:   Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.      |
| Shuddeni:  Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.       |
| Srryn:     Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.   |
|                                                                          |
| All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do   |
| not exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical      |
| maturity for their lineage, which may vary between species.              |
|                                                                          |
| Each lineage will have different innate traits (such as flight or        |
| darkvision) and a different spread of maximum statistics. For more       |
| information, including a table of max stats, see HELP STATISTICS.        |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Most chaja communities live in isolated strongholds in the Brintor       |
| mountains, ordering their lives by the stars.  Owing to this isolation,  |
| chaja are most widely known across Avendar for their use by the shuddeni |
| as slaves, particularly during the War of Night.  Chaja are caprine      |
| giants with wooly hair covering most of their bodies, uniformly pale     |
| eyes, and small, nubby horns.  They are nearly as tall as the alatharya, |
| but have rounder, softer bodies with little muscle definition.  Their    |
| size allows them to wield two-handed weapons in a single hand.  They     |
| can see in darkness, and may safely eat nearly anything.  For more       |
| information, read HELP CHAJA.                                            |

The Beginning
  The School of Heroes is hidden in a remote valley in the Yagash
Mountains, and the cold bite of high elevation swirls around you under a
perpetually overcast sky.  Gilded symbols of the gods Dolgrael, Lilune, and
Jolinn have been lovingly sculpted into massive doors of dark basalt that
lock fast behind you.  There is no way back; only forward.  

Whether due to triumph or tragedy, a drive to desperate heroism or sadistic
villainy, you have come to this remote place and secured your adventurer's
license from the School of Heroes.  You have completed your official
training and registration and stand now before the Tower of Testing, where
your final practical examinations await you.  

You may leave through the portals connected to different towns on the
continent of Avendar in the Tower of Testing ahead, but you are encouraged
to proceed with your practical examination, as it will impart many valuable
skills and items for your life ahead.

The Foyer of the School of Heroes
  The School of Heroes begins with a grand foyer, complete with a vaulted
ceiling held aloft by great marble columns.  The room is spacious and airy,
with high, white marble walls and mounted, shining globes to provide light. 
Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.  

A large sign sits off to one side, offering directions to students.

[Exits: north east south west up down]
(!) A mossy-haired caladaran woman sits at the reception desk.
Jimacha tells you, 'Khuruin, my name is Jimacha.  May the gods bless you with reason.'
Jimacha tells you, 'The School of Heroes is meant to teach you the skills required for adventuring.'
Jimacha tells you, 'You should explore its sections thoroughly before you proceed to the Tower of
Testing.'
Jimacha tells you, 'Make sure you are armed and proceed with caution-- the Tower is full of
monsters!'
Jimacha tells you, 'If you ascend it successfully, you will be rewarded with the School sigil.'
Jimacha tells you, 'With it, you should feel ready to explore Avendar at large.'

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white

magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double

Office of Applied Theology
  The office interior exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek
white marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of
hanging magelights.  An angular obelisk of black marble sits in the middle
of the chamber, deeply graven with images that spark with poisonous crimson
light.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part

  The Brintor Road continues to push through the rolling foothills, leading
to the mountain communities to the north.  Ahead, the Brintor Range towers
majestically, the snow-capped peaks reaching to the heavens.  The evergreens

  A twisting mountain trail bends its way between outcroppings of stone,

itself in several places, and the similarity of the terrain makes it
difficult to recognize landmarks or directions.  In the distance to the

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes

of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The chaja were the first lineage to settle the Brintor mountains,
building many great towering stone spires in homage to their starry goddess,
Kyana.  In obeisance to her foresight, they retreated underground enmasse,
establishing isolated strongholds within the mountains.  Soon after their
exodus, the aelin would settle in their former homes, mistaking their
majestic spires for alatharyan ruins; they would be scoured to dust within
centuries by the War of Fire.  

Chaja are now a largely subterranean people within the Brintors, their
mastery of the druidic arts transforming their underground caverns into
sunlit, verdant spaces.  The influences of the gods Elanthe and Kurion
alongside Kyana have made them a stoic people .  Owing to their isolation,
chaja are known outside the mountains for their frequent use as slaves by
the shuddeni, particularly during the War of Night when they were forced to
be shock troops.  The shuddeni continue to predate upon the chaja,
kidnapping them for enslavement as laborers, hunters, or servants.  Crude
stereotypes and lingering prejudice have made chaja lives in outside cities
such as Earendam or Ashta Harrud frustrating ones.  They can frequently be
found commiserating with alatharya, who experience similar prejudices.  

Ranging between six and eight feet tall, chaja are quite stout and vaguely
caprine in appearance, with flat noses and small blunt horns often hidden in
their thick, wooly hair ranging in colour from cream to brown to black. 
They are quite hirsute, often growing mantles of long shaggy hair across
their shoulders, chest, and back, and both sexes may grow beards.  Young
chaja have much lighter hair and skin that darkens with age, and their eyes
are either colourless or very pale, without a visible pupil or sclera.  The
lingering blessing of Kyana allows chaja to see perfectly in darkness, and
they can eat almost anything without ill effect.  Their stature allows them
to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.

make his intentions and mood harder to decipher.  A coarse beard covers his
face, braided with two similar braids as his hair, Thick strands of braided
spider-silk seems custom fashioned to bind, wrap, braid, or otherwise keep
his hair from impairing his vision.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Activation lag  :  2.0 rounds
Activation cost :  20 mana


Syntax: Cross

Gladiators wielding a weapon (srryn or kankoran claws will also suffice) are
able to step close to their opponents in combat, crossing weapons with them.
They can then take advantage of this to sharply knee their opponent, dealing
bash damage and potentially lagging them.

Activation cost :  15 mana


Syntax: Whirl

A gladiator wielding any weapon (or one's own natural claws) may lash out in a
whirling blow, slamming it through everyone else nearby, dealing damage.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Activation lag  :  2.0 rounds
Activation cost :  15 mana


Syntax: Kick

Bandits and gladiators, both comfortable with using dirty tricks in combat,
are able to shatter their opponent's knee when they kick at them. It is more
difficult to shatter the knee of someone whose skin is protected by the stone
skin or stone shell spells. Characters who have a shattered knee will have
markedly reduced dexterity, will be slowed if they walk, and consume extra
movement points when they do walk. Flying will naturally obviate the latter
two penalties, but the first will still apply. Someone with a shattered knee
will have a much harder time kicking people themselves.

  To the north, the path veers sharply toward a cluster of low foothills. 
An opening in the face of the nearest hill leads into a cavern, and to the
south, the lower foothills spread vastly.  Far in the distance, the peaks of
the Brintor Mountains tower above the horizon, a grand spectacle in the
background.

The Mouth of the Cave
  A gap in the face of the hill opens into a large cave.  The walls are
slick with condensed moisture and growths of fungus.  There is a musty air
to the natural passage that leads north.  Many footprints mar the soft dirt
of the cave floor, packing it into a regular path in some areas.

moisture, and subterranean fungi grow in colored patches.  The dirt of the

  This stretch of cave is crowded with mining equipment, bedrolls for
several men, provisions, and various clutter.  Apparently this is the
temporary camp of a mining party.  Further evidence lies in a mine shaft
sunk into the west wall of the cave, and three mine carts partially filled
with ore.  The main cave continues north and south.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

was once a leather shop of some sort.  Bare hooks line the walls, where once
merchandise must have hung.  An old counter sits near the back, emptied and
dusty.  A small sign tacked up to the wall indicates that the prior owner
was forced to close shop due to a family emergency, and that there is no
planned date of re-opening.  To the north, you can hear the sounds and
bustle of Iron Street.

<175hp 124m 26mv> Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
south is the leatherworker's shop.  East is Sadrent Road.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

A Run-Down Weaponry
  This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling
is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop's unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

The Saurian Armory
  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop's north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air
of the city.

  A small room fronts this establishment, a curtained-off door concealing
anything further in.  A creaky old desk fills entirely too much of the room,
covered in papers and carefully-stacked scrolls.  The walls are covered in
old handbills announcing bounties long since collected, gladiatorial bouts
from at least a year ago, and a few advertisments for local shops.  The
floor is kept cleaner than anything else in the place, and it too bears the
signs of too many feet walking over it.

  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  A small group of men

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

Western Outskirts of Earendam
  Beyond the bare ground of the city walls begin the Grasslands of
Earendam, a vast sea of green vegetation that stirs and whispers softly in
the breeze.  The long Earendam grasses grow to your waist, and so densely as
to slow progress through the area.  The walls of the city Earendam are
visible nearby to the east.  To the south the Arien Road cuts through the
grass.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

(Translucent) A magic mouth hovers in mid-air, grinning nonchalantly.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor is generally shaped
like a cross, with two long intersecting hallways.  The floor here is the
same rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This hallway continues south, while the
stairwell to the first floor lies to the north.

The Intersection on the Second Floor
  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor here is the same
rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This area serves as a point of
intersection between the two hallways of the floor, with one going east and
west, and the other going north and south.

A Glass Stairwell
  The second floor comes to an end with a stairwell leading upward.  The
tower here begins a transition away from the rough-hewn stone of the lower
levels toward white brick and tile, much like that of the School of Heroes. 
The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor below, with high glass
panels that follow the stairs as they proceed further up.  From here you
have a pleasant but commanding view of Avendar's distant horizons, with
vents letting in further fresh air from above.  The stairway is
significantly warmer than below.

The Beginning of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  To the south, a glass-enclosed stairwell descends to the
second floor, while the current one continues to the north.

A Corner on the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  The hall turns here, its two exits to the east and south.

Dual wielding is the ability to use an additional weapon in the character's
offhand. Weapons being dual wielded will suffer a slight penalty in the amount
of damage and have a lesser chance of iterative attacks. Weapon weight must be
considered with this skill, as only weapons lighter then the one being wielded
in the main hand are capable of being dual wielded. Swordmasters are exempt
from this restriction, and can dual wield nearly any two swords they can hold.
Certain unwieldy combinations of weapons will be more awkward to defend
oneself with.

Large-sized races, such as the chaja or alatharya, are able to hold certain
kinds of two-handed weapons with one hand, and dual wield them. The balance of
spears, staves, and polearms are such that this is not possible for these
weapons.

The ambidextrous trait, available upon creation and given to gladiators and
swordmasters automatically, reduces but does not remove the weight
restrictions (though swordmasters have none in either case).

Shield block is the art of using a shield to ward off blows in melee. This
skill is primarily effective against daggers, and least effective against
whips, flails, maces, and axes. Shield block is the favoured defense
of of water and Void templars and most fighters, though other schools teach
the skill as well.

It's much harder to shield block after an arm has been boneshattered.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell leads upward to the fourth floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The white stones of the third level end at the entrance to this
stairwell, instead replaced by the iconic marble of the School's main level.
The tile floor looks less worn and of a higher sheen, and the stairwell
itself is polished to a high gloss.  Arched windows look out onto the world
at large, high enough to give the faint of heart a bit of pause.  The sounds
of battle ring out from the floor above.  The long hall of the third floor
lies to the north.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

cool but smells of exertion, blood, and spellcraft.  Lanterns hang from the
high ceiling, lighting the chamber at night, while natural light filters in
through arched windows during the day.  A stairwell leads down to the third
floor to the west, while the chamber continues north and east.

walls of high marble.  The ceiling is vaulted and extravagant, the entire
expanse forming a wide open battle arena.  The tiles of the floor compose a
patterned relief of the iconic sigil of the School of Heroes.  The air is
cool but smells of exertion, blood, and spellcraft.  Lanterns hang from the
high ceiling, lighting the chamber at night, while natural light filters in
through arched windows during the day.  A stairwell leads down to the third

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.

Syntax: Gouge <target>

A trick learned by the arena-fighting gladiators but also used by druids who
have taken on the aspect of the hawk, this skill is an attempt to tear at
another person's eyes. This will deal a small amount of damage and blind them,
if successful.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

  A sooty and dank place, this building houses the Company of the Serpent,
one of Earendam's chartered mercenary companies.  Hand-crafted from clay
bricks, the building is built flush with Earendam's west wall.  This room
seems devoid of furnishings, save an ancient desk.  The only illumination in
the room comes from a pitch lantern, which fills the room with a black smoke
while providing only fitful illumination.  The street lies east through an

sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones

way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part

drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

With their training often placing them in a tight spot or vastly outnumbered
for showmanship and crowd-pleasing affects, gladiators are able to fight in
such a way that they are able to take a full round of attacks against each
opponent who is fighting them. Contrary to popular belief, the visual
spectacle of this skill is solely reliant on the sheer number of attacks;
this skill provides no bonus damage to the gladiator at any time.

The Wench's Lute
  This shop lies just off of the east end of Raddin Street, and is exactly
as dingy as one might expect for the surroundings.  One of the windows is
boarded over, and the other is made of bubbled, foggy glass.  An imitation
Harrudim rug covers most of the uneven floor, and a roughly made counter is
toward the east side of the room.  Instruments are mounted on the walls
along with dim lights, providing examples of the shop's wares.  A wooden
doorway leads west.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
east is Sadrent Road.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

The Beginning of the First Floor
  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
north, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill the
quiet air.

A Breezy Stairwell
  This stairwell is in the far northeast, just outside of the first floor
proper.  It is rugged and dark, lit with flickering torches.  However, as
the stairs climb higher, the chill cling of the air lessens and the basement
scent dims.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing
the flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and
smooth, suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the

The East Side of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls save the uncharacteristic cleanliness
of the western one.  The hall continues north and south.

Your character advances in power by gaining experience. The amount of 
experience you need to advance a level will increase as your level 
increases.
  
You gain experience by: 
     * Being part of a group that kills a monster 
     * Gaining mastery of a skill 
     * Completing certain quests or tasks 
     * Exploring new places
  
You lose experience if: 
     * You and the mobile you kill are both good-aligned 
  
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: 
     * How many players are in your group, and their levels
     * Your level versus the level of the creature 
     * Your alignment versus the creature's alignment 
     * Some random variation.

Additionally, there are some creatures of great power which will take you 
much longer to kill than regular foes. If you are successful in slaying 
such foes, you may find that you learn substantially more experience than 
is normal.

Working in a group may be the most effective way of gaining experience.
However, the amount of experience you earn will decrease for each person
in your group after the first three; thus, the optimum group size for
earning experience is three, though groups both larger and smaller have
been known to be effective as well. Note that charmed mobiles in your
group do not count against the group total for purposes for experience.
  
While anyone may group with anyone else who is willing, experience will
be doled out according to group contribution. For example, a level 10 who
is grouped with a level 50 will receive significantly less experience for
the same kill than if he were grouped with a level 20 instead. On the
other hand, the level 50 could help him kill much larger prey, and thus
may (or may not) ultimately prove a more useful groupmate.

The East Side of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls save the uncharacteristic cleanliness
of the western one.  The hall continues north and south.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Activation lag  :  0.0 rounds

Dual wielding is the ability to use an additional weapon in the character's
offhand. Weapons being dual wielded will suffer a slight penalty in the amount
of damage and have a lesser chance of iterative attacks. Weapon weight must be
considered with this skill, as only weapons lighter then the one being wielded
in the main hand are capable of being dual wielded. Swordmasters are exempt
from this restriction, and can dual wield nearly any two swords they can hold.
Certain unwieldy combinations of weapons will be more awkward to defend
oneself with.

Large-sized races, such as the chaja or alatharya, are able to hold certain
kinds of two-handed weapons with one hand, and dual wield them. The balance of
spears, staves, and polearms are such that this is not possible for these
weapons.

The ambidextrous trait, available upon creation and given to gladiators and
swordmasters automatically, reduces but does not remove the weight
restrictions (though swordmasters have none in either case).

Cost: 2 trains

This trait represents a character's natural ambidexterity, which manifests
itself in being able to dual wield heavier weapons.  In practice, this means
the off hand weapon can be closer to the main hand weapon's weight than would
otherwise be possible.

Swordmasters and gladiators automatically receive this trait upon creation,
though it is merely a formality for swordmasters; they may dual wield any two
swords regardless of weight.

  The fifth floor is among the oldest parts of the Tower of Testing, built
of heavy, rough-hewn stone.  The arched windows and smooth, worn stone

A Small Granite Chamber
  This stone chamber is built from smooth blocks of pale granite, four
bracketed torches ensconced on each wall.  The ceiling is high and largely
oddly disorienting, as the floor and walls are all the same color and

cool air of the Tower's great height.  The marble floor is covered in a

room.  The view outside is little more than a cloudscape, with the sun and
moons clearly visible to occupants.  The chamber continues to the south.

The Roof of the Tower of Testing

magic, but otherwise is entirely unencumbered.  It includes a large central
platform, upon which six slender spires rise, matching a convex hexagon's
points.  The golden staircase from below arrives between two of such spires,
allowing admission to the platform.  The glittering stone of the rooftop
shines in both sunlight and moonlight, and the shrill wind whips between the
spires.  The surrounding skyscape is above the clouds, their wispy expanse

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower

is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is a place for friends
to gather before entering the Tower of Testing, which trains young
adventurers in the ways of battle.  The dim echoes of its sounds filter back
into the lounge now and then, as a solemn reminder of how all students
eventually make their fortunes.  To the west and south, the lounge

exercises.

banner informs students of where the stairs lead, and provides a splash of
color to an otherwise dark and grey passage.  Footsteps echo here, and the

l caladaran
An academic of mild statue, Jeskach is a lean, middle-aged caladaran with
skin like birch bark.  His hair is a wild, bushy tangle akin to unruly
shrubbery; it provides a comical offset to the seriousness of his
expression.  A dedicant of Chadraln, he spent much of his youth studying the
known world within the Earendam Library.  His focus shifted when he was
hired by the enigmatic owner of the School of Heroes, instead spending his
days imparting some of his knowledge.  Now he administers the Test of the
Statue, and indulges his love of reading when not otherwise occupied.  
Jeskach is in excellent condition.

  The side corridor runs east and west, sloping downward as it proceeds
from the Hall of Trials.  The walls are cut from rough-hewn stone, and the
passing of endless years has left them uneven.  Tiny patches of moss cling
to the rock, and a slow drip of water makes the close air damp as well as
musty.  Hanging lamps light the corridor, although they flicker off and on,
making the light seem less steady than the floors above.  To the east, the
passage returns to the School proper, while to the west, it is interrupted

origin is the subject of many rumors, it is both animate and aware.  It
chose this space for itself not long after the initial renovation of the

conversation.  The room itself is a simple affair, with matching hardwood
paneling and flooring.  Two potted plants sit near the rear of the room, one

It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's

An imposing, dark-skinned man with piercing eyes, Zebenar Kinest is the
most recent owner of the School of Heroes.  His coal-black hair is
well-groomed, matching both his opulent surroundings and the fine cut of his
clothing.  Once a famed scourge of young adventurers throughout Avendar, he
eventually realized there were safer ways to indulge in his amusements. 
Using the fortunes he had amassed through his famous exploits, he purchased
the School of Heroes for its disconcerting record of imp-related training
accidents.  He now rewards those who survive the Tower of Testing with a
small token of his esteem.

The Hall of Victors
  The Hall of Victors houses the emissary of the family of the School of
Heroes' illustrious founder, and it is his task to reward those valiant
young adventurers who complete the Tower of Testing.  The rough-hewn stone
of the arched entryway gives way to a set of two large steps, and then a
large, circular platform made of polished tiles.  The walls transition
almost immediately into the School's characteristic marble.  The entrance to
the Hall of Victors lies to the west, while an opulent chamber lies to the

armored in plate mail, save a helmet, leaving his head fully visible.  

The other half is a silvery, feminine figure.  She is heavily stylized,
bearing two separate faces.  One possesses two diamond eyes and a soothing
smile; the other has eyes of inset ruby and a fierce, grinning mouth.  Her
body is lithe and robed in draping, silken cloth.  

The two forms are fused at the back to one another, never to face each
other.  His clutched fist and her outstretched hand beckon to all who see
them.

An imposing, dark-skinned man with piercing eyes, Zebenar Kinest is the
most recent owner of the School of Heroes.  His coal-black hair is
well-groomed, matching both his opulent surroundings and the fine cut of his
clothing.  Once a famed scourge of young adventurers throughout Avendar, he
eventually realized there were safer ways to indulge in his amusements. 
Using the fortunes he had amassed through his famous exploits, he purchased
the School of Heroes for its disconcerting record of imp-related training
accidents.  He now rewards those who survive the Tower of Testing with a
small token of his esteem.

<310hp 172m 214mv> The Entrance to the Hall of Victors
  This spur off of the Adventurer's Lounge leads to a tremendous archway. 
It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's
interior lies east, while the lounge is to the west.

  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower
of Testing.  This space, however, is known as the Adventurer's Lounge, which
is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is arranged with chairs
and couches much like the rest, with a large, well-worn area rug in the
middle.  Notably, a well-polished bar stands against the south wall, and an
additional hallway leads to the east.  The lounge continues to the north and

linger.  Far to the north is the entrance to the Tower of Testing.

  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling

  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
north, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill the
quiet air.

paneling and flooring.  Two potted plants sit near the rear of the room, one

with high, white marble walls and mounted, shining globes to provide light. 
Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.

The End of the Hall of Professions
  The Hall of Professions come to an end here, with the last of its
trainers.  This wing of the School of Heroes is dedicated to training in
basic skills and themes, so young adventurers know what to expect from their
future.  Broad, professional trainers serve the School in this function,
offering information and help to students of various guilds.  To the east, a
wild grove grows of its own accord to assist young naturalists.  To the
west, a small sanctuary serves young mentalists in their future endeavors.

A Wild Grove
  A small but curious grove grows within the School of Heroes, complete
with perception-defying trees and small animals.  The chamber itself has
given way to a great canopy above, which serves as a makeshift ceiling.  The
great shadow of the limbs above gives the room a dank, earthy feel, with
luminescent moss bathing the area in a blue glow.  The clatter of animals
and birds within the branches very much makes this place feel like a
fragment of the deepest wild.  A doorway to the west leads back into the
civilized world of the Hall of Professions.  

A single white-plumed arrow stands upright in the rich earth.

A Quiet Sanctuary
  This small room is reminiscent of a monastic cell.  It is simply
furnished, with white-paneled wood covering the stone walls.  A few simple
paintings hang from them, one of them depicting four flowers; another a
prismatic snowflake; and another showing a stylized dove.  The floor is
covered by reed mats, darkened with dye.  A low table sits at room's center,
and upon it is a bronze statuette.  The room is lit by a simple bronze
ceiling mount, allowing warm light to filter down.  The Hall of Professions
lies through a doorway to the east.

The Hall of Professions
  The Hall of Professions serves all young adventurers, supplying them with
access to the basic skills of their trades.  Each classroom provides
information for beginners on what to expect from the guild, and where their
power will one day lie.  The floor and walls are made from granite, lending
a cool, clean feel to the hall itself.  To the east lies a shadowy alcove
where young rogues can find instruction, while to the west a training room
serves starting templars.  The Hall of Professions continues to the north
and south.

<310hp 172m 208mv> 
The Beginning of the Hall of Professions
  The Hall of Professions is the part of the School of Heroes dedicated to
the training of adventurers in their respective guilds.  Since many of the
skills taught here are rudimentary, many of Avendar's individual guilds are
not represented; instead, a broader professional trainer serves each
respective classification.  The floor and walls are made from granite,
giving the hallway itself a cool, clean feel.  To the east is a fighting pit
where young warriors train, while to the west, a well-supplied classroom
lends itself to the instruction of rudimentary scholars.  The Hall of
Professions continues to the north, while the School's foyer is to the
south.

The Foyer of the School of Heroes
  The School of Heroes begins with a grand foyer, complete with a vaulted
ceiling held aloft by great marble columns.  The room is spacious and airy,
with high, white marble walls and mounted, shining globes to provide light. 
Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.  

A large sign sits off to one side, offering directions to students.

The Entrance to the Hall of Arms
  The Hall of Arms is named so because it is intended to introduce all
young adventurers to the tools of their trade: weapons and armor.  The
entrance to the Hall is patterned differently than the foyer to the west;
instead of marble columns, it has gilded plating which covers the ceiling
above.  The floor is patterned with polished tile, although instead of
depicting the sigil of the School itself, it is a stylized sword and shield.
The scent of heated copper and smoke is dimly present in the room,
suggesting a forge within a reasonable proximity.  The Hall branches out to
the north, east, and south.

  This branch of the Hall of Arms includes the same pale stone and gilded

sparingly, offering a bench along the western wall for students to sit.  A
counter lines the south wall, made of polished wood.  The walls and the
front of the counter are decorated with various examples of the School's
in-house wares, including copper mail, shields, and cloth or hide
stitchwork.  The armory is well-lit and well-maintained on all accounts.  To

which sells support items and consumables to young adventurers.  The room
shares the pale stone and gilded ceilings of the rest of the Hall, as well
as the same polished tile floor.  Cases along the north and south wall show
examples of the shop's wares and includes information on their individual
properties.  The shop is clean and brightly lit, welcoming students at all

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  A carved shield
marks the door of an armory to the north, while a hanging sign emblazoned
with a sword calls attention to the weapon shop to the south.  Raddin street
continues to the east, while the main drag of Sadrent road opens to the

  This shop lies just off of the east end of Raddin Street, and is exactly
as dingy as one might expect for the surroundings.  One of the windows is
boarded over, and the other is made of bubbled, foggy glass.  An imitation
Harrudim rug covers most of the uneven floor, and a roughly made counter is
toward the east side of the room.  Instruments are mounted on the walls
along with dim lights, providing examples of the shop's wares.  A wooden

  A small room fronts this establishment, a curtained-off door concealing
anything further in.  A creaky old desk fills entirely too much of the room,
covered in papers and carefully-stacked scrolls.  The walls are covered in
old handbills announcing bounties long since collected, gladiatorial bouts
from at least a year ago, and a few advertisments for local shops.  The
floor is kept cleaner than anything else in the place, and it too bears the
signs of too many feet walking over it.

its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  A small group of men

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way

founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into

  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

and built into pinnacles some six feet high.  The gates themselves have long
since vanished, and all that remains of them are the heavy iron hinges,
bolted to the stone.  Thick ivy covers the gateposts, and the surrounding
shrubs almost completely obscure their presence.  To the south the path

lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north

A Rutted Carriageway 
  Here outer walls of the mansion are intact, although covered with patches
of ivy, and badly weathered.  The carriageway becomes quite muddy here,
with a small, trickling stream running from the eastern road-bank, into one
of the carriage ruts, and southward.  Leafy boughs overhang the path, and a
few thistles grow up from amongst the broken cobblestones.  Some way to the
south is a wooden building, while to the north the carriage-way continues
toward the front of the mansion.

A Rutted Carriageway 
  The carriageway runs past another partially-collapsed section of the
building here.  The lower floor still stands, but the upper has crumbled to
ruin.  Nothing remains of the walls above but a few jutting fingers of
stone, silhouetted against the sky.  Amongst the stones perches a leering
gargoyle, its form horribly reptillian.  A stream of water trickles along
one of the ruts in the ground, flowing from north to south.  To the south
the path soon comes to an end, by the wide doors of an old carriage house. 
To the north the path continues beneath the overhanging, leafy boughs.

Before an Old Carriage House
  The overgrown carriageway comes to an end here, at the doors of a wooden
carriage house, just to the south.  The building was once painted red, but
has now faded and flaked to a pinkish-brown.  Many of the tiles of its
triangular roof have slipped, and lie scattered on the ground, and the whole
structure looks slightly lopsided.  A trickling stream of water flows under
the front doors, into the building.  To the west a cobbled footpath begins,
and winds around the side of the carriage house, toward the grounds of the
mansion.

  A magnificent oak tree spreads its limbs over this part of the garden,
shading the acorn-scattered ground with its thick foliage.  The creepers and
vines, so thick to the north, still cover some of the ground here, and climb
up the lower parts of the oak's trunk.  However a new invader is beginning
to drive back the ivy - thick growths of blackberry rise in an impenetrable
wall to the south, and sprawl over a dilapidated carriage house to the east,
their strangling tendrils stretching out toward the oak.  To the west the
ground seems to have been cleared somewhat.

An Old Carriage House
  This simple wooden structure is designed to hold both carriage and
horses, though the two stalls for the latter stand empty.  The carriage
house is all of wood, with an earthen floor, and seems termite ridden and
fragile.  Several wooden tiles from the roof have come loose, leaving large
gaps in some places.  A thin stream of water flows beneath the large, double
doors to the north, through the carriage house, and beneath a furrow under

many cases, and low-hanging branches have been ripped from trees.  To the
west, a thick stand of blackberries lies in tatters from the passage.  To
the north is the rear of an old, wooden building, which seems to have been
the origin of the destruction, as a great hole gapes in the wall, and
shattered wood is strewn across the forest floor.  To the south, somewhat

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

what that means and what our expectations with regards to behavior are. 
These standards and guidelines apply to players and staff alike. 
Individuals that violate these guidelines will face penalties ranging from
uncomfortable conversations to denial to removal of all privileges and
access to the game entirely.  

Avendar is not a business or a service and we do not have customers.  This
is a hobby which we invite others to enjoy with us in a space we curate. 
Every part of the game will always be free, and no advantage will ever be
offered to a player character for donations given to assist Avendar in its
operation costs.  

The atmosphere we want to cultivate is that of a group of acquaintances
coming together at a person's house to play a tabletop adventure game with a
big roleplaying aspect, such as Pathfinder.  Even as our characters may
engage in conflicts both along and against one another, those should not
influence how we treat one another around the table, so to speak.  We don't
have to be best friends, but we expect civility and for people to refrain
from behavior that is malicious, harmful, or unsportsmanlike.  If you aren't
sure whether something is going to be a problem, ask.  If something
genuinely bothers to you, politely bring it up either directly or with a
staff member.  This applies to every space within the locus of our control,
including the Avendar game itself, the official Discord server, and this
wiki.  

We have no interest in developing an exhaustive and specific list of things
you can and cannot do and instead advise you use all of the above as a
guideline.  That said, this is a short list of activities which are
egregiously unacceptable, and will get you immediately denied and/or
banned:

* Any expression of real-world bigotry including but not limited to racism,
misogyny, homophobia, or transphobia
* Pedophilia or explicit child sexual material of any kind
* Explicit depictions or discussions of rape or sexual assault
* Out-of-character stalking, harassment, or bullying, regardless of where it
happens

In general, we emphasize remembering that there are real people that will be
reading whatever you write within the game.  As we detail in HELP
ROLEPLAYING, we do not shy away from scenes or stories about difficult
subjects, but we do expect it to be approached in a way that is responsible
and respectful of others.  For more detailed information about what that
entails, please read HELP ROLEPLAYING.  

While PvP is uncommon, whenever you are logged in there is a chance you will
become engaged in PvP with another player which may result in the death of
your character and the theft of that character's items.  Murder and theft
are permitted and encouraged forms of play.  Staff will not intervene in or
adjudicate in-character conflicts between player characters.  We expect
those who engage in PvP to behave in a way that is sportsmanlike and fair;
behaviors such as (but not limited to) timing your log-ins to avoid
retribution or deliberately targeting new players will not be tolerated.  

The game environment including the world and mechanics of Avendar are
provided to you as-is to enjoy and may be incomplete or buggy.  Knowingly
abusing an exploit for any reason will result in all of a player's current
characters being denied and, depending on the severity, being banned from
the game entirely.

  The tables are scattered around the room in what seems to be a random
fashion, but there is still ample space for the barmaids to walk through to
set out food and drinks.  A large fireplace dominates the south wall, the
hearth is swept and ready for a warm fire during the winter.  A small
staircase leads upwards in the south-west corner of the room, to the
comfortable beds waiting for a weary customer to rest upon.  East are the
swinging doors leading to the kitchen, and north lies the entrance to the

Avendar is a MUD that supports roleplaying, player versus environment
(PvE), and player versus player (PvP) modes of play.  This page will discuss
what that means and what our expectations with regards to behavior are. 
These standards and guidelines apply to players and staff alike. 
Individuals that violate these guidelines will face penalties ranging from
uncomfortable conversations to denial to removal of all privileges and
access to the game entirely.  

Avendar is not a business or a service and we do not have customers.  This
is a hobby which we invite others to enjoy with us in a space we curate. 
Every part of the game will always be free, and no advantage will ever be
offered to a player character for donations given to assist Avendar in its
operation costs.  

The atmosphere we want to cultivate is that of a group of acquaintances
coming together at a person's house to play a tabletop adventure game with a
big roleplaying aspect, such as Pathfinder.  Even as our characters may

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

east, while some scattered tables are south.

Scattered Tables
  These scattered wooden tables are filled by warriors, come to the tavern
for its reknowned mead.  Lanterns hang down from chains attached to the
ceiling, providing illumination for this tall room.  To the east is the
common area, while a large throng of people has gathered to the south.  More
tables lie to the north.

Fighting Pit
  A large throng of warriors gather around the pit sunk in the southern
half of the room, waiting to watch the next fight.  Gladiators often test
their mettle here for some quick gold, usually by fighting for the purse put
up betting pool.  To the north, are some scattered tables, but there are no
other exits from this part of the inn.

The Common Room of the Tipsy Swordmaster
  The common room of the Tipsy Swordmaster is a riot of activity. 
Waitresses work their way through the crowd, stolidly ignoring the ogling of
the crowd of rowdy warriors.  The room is illuminated by cast iron lanterns,
which hang down from the ceiling on long chains, serving as a crude sort of
chandelier.  The inn stretches out in all directions, though more people
seem to be clustered about the bar to the south.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

A Run-Down Weaponry
  This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling
is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop's unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

The Saurian Armory
  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop's north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air
of the city.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
east is Sadrent Road.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

The Forge of the Golden Sands
  This cramped, low room is thick with a smoky haze, the dry, warm air
heavy with the acrid smells of the forge.  A large, cluttered workbench
fills one corner entirely, covered with scraps of metal and a jumble of
tools.  In another corner, a round forge made from bricks of shaped clay
glows brightly, the orange-red light pouring through the small, grilled
opening.  A low counter divides the room from north to south, and several
low cushions of rich fabric have been set out for customers to wait upon. 
The low roofbeams of aged wood are charred slightly in a few places, but
otherwise the shop is quite well-kept.  A floor of magically smooth stone is
clean and neat, but for accumulated splashes of spilled metal near the
forge.  A rich tapestry hangs on the east wall, beside a luxurious, gilded
door.  The room is lit by several glowing orbs above the workbench, tempered
with the fiery light of the forge.  

A slate sign rests upon the counter.

<468hp 468m 283mv> The Forest Path
  A thin but well worn path winds through the forest of Nendor.  Stones
inscribed with odd runic markings dot the side of the path every now and
again, standing on the border between road and forest.  Large oaks line the
path on either side, leaves casting shade upon the path below.  The singing
of birds echoes through the forest, providing a constant murmur of sound.  The
path curves south from the west, leading deeper into the forest.

A Small Clearing
  This grassy clearing is obviously frequented by animal life.  The grass
is trampled down by the many animal tracks leading into and out of the
underbrush surrounding the clearing.  The bark upon the trunks of one of the
nearby elms is slashed, a marker of some sort.  Through the trees
surrounding the clearing you can see a forest path to the north and west.

mountains visible over the western horizon.  Clouds rarely pass through the
sky overhead, and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are
rapidly evaporated by the burning sun.  The vegetation here is sparse, with

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
cultures, and/or aesthetics.  Please see the relevant help files and the
wiki for more information.  

Updates to our in-game help files to accurately represent added skills,
spells, and other mechanical changes are in progress.  In the mean time,
please check out our website or direct any questions to our Discord.  

Thanks for playing with us, we hope you have fun.

The General Outfitter
  This is where the upper class comes to buy the more general things needed
to exist.  From candles to boxes, the shop has everything that an individual
might need to live a productive life.  Several potted plants of various
sizes sit against the side walls and a few pieces of semi-tasteful art hang
from the wall.  You can head back out onto Commerce Street to the east.

Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined

  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type

  You stand outside the north wall of Var Bandor.  In the distance to the
north, the Dantaron river splits into two forks which flow around Var Bandor
on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows
the outskirts.

A Damp Cave
  The winding cave splits into a four-way intersection, with one branch
twisting north and the other branches curving west, south, and east.  Water
drips from the ceiling, forming puddles on the cave floor, and the soft
earth that lines the cave floor to the south slowly fades to the north and
west.

A Luminous Cave
  The walls and ceiling of this rounded cave are coated with multicolored
fungi which give off a faint luminesence.  The red, green, and yellow
glowing patches provide enough light to see without further aid.  Trails of
slime criss-cross the walls, disturbing the patterns of colored light. 
Littering the floor are dried pieces of chitin and shards of a thick shell.

  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

Inside the Southern Gatehouse
  The southern gatehouse of Var Bandor is an elaborate affair,
well-maintained and proper.  A close watch is kept on the kind of traveler
allowed to enter the finest districts of the city, and a roster of those
banned from the area is kept nearby.  The immense granite walls rise to
either side of the gates, and to the south, the outskirts of Var Bandor run
into a thickly wooded area.  North, Ilrin Street leads into the heart of the

Fighting Pit
  A large throng of warriors gather around the pit sunk in the southern
half of the room, waiting to watch the next fight.  Gladiators often test
their mettle here for some quick gold, usually by fighting for the purse put
up betting pool.  To the north, are some scattered tables, but there are no
other exits from this part of the inn.

the crowd of rowdy warriors.  The room is illuminated by cast iron lanterns,
which hang down from the ceiling on long chains, serving as a crude sort of

  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy

pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of

Trail into the Forest
  This trail winds its way southward, through the downland south of Var
Bandor, toward the Forest of Nendor.  The edges of the dirt path are lined
with smooth stones.  Stony grassland spreads to either side beyond the chalk
stone border, and the Nendorin woods spread before you to the south.  Back

The Forest Path
  A thin but well worn path winds through the forest of Nendor.  Stones
inscribed with odd runic markings dot the side of the path every now and
again, standing on the border between road and forest.  Large oaks line the
path on either side, leaves casting shade upon the path below.  The singing
of birds echoes through the forest, providing a constant murmur of sound.  The
path runs south from the north, leading deeper into the forest.  To the
east and west, breaks in the thick treeline are visible.

again some way further on, heading ever eastward.

overgrown.  The stones are now pushed askew by grasses and saplings, or lie
buried in the mud which crowds in from the edges.  The leafy boughs of the

  Looming above you to the south is an old, stone mansion.  The building is
two stories high, with a tall bluestone tower set into the northwestern
corner. Most of this front face of the mansion is covered with thick ivy,
blending the building with the surrounding forest.  Only a few patches of
lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north
into the forest, turns east here, and disappears around the side of the
mansion. A set of heavy oak doors hang loose on their hinges to the south.

  The carriageway runs beneath the front, northern face of an old,
ivy-covered mansion here.  This face of the mansion is intact, although
badly weathered, and a few shattered windows peek out from amidst the shroud
of green.  Looking through these windows, it seems that the rooms
immediately behind this wall have collapsed into ruin.  A little way to the
east the carriage-way turns around the side of the building and heads south,
while directly to the west it runs past the mansion's front door.  The thick
growth of the forest blocks the way north.

house.  Nearer-by, the forest presses in from the east and north, with leafy
boughs leaning over the path.  The mansion, ruined in places, looms to the

just to the west, and stones lie scattered across the path, moss-covered and

although the walls are beginning to crumble.  The carriage-way passes
beneath these walls before reaching a smaller, wooden structure in the
distance.  To the east the forest presses thickly against the road.

few thistles grow up from amongst the broken cobblestones.  Some way to the

gargoyle, its form horribly reptillian.  A stream of water trickles along
one of the ruts in the ground, flowing from north to south.  To the south

triangular roof have slipped, and lie scattered on the ground, and the whole
structure looks slightly lopsided.  A trickling stream of water flows under
the front doors, into the building.  To the west a cobbled footpath begins,

mansion.

Upon Marshy Ground
  The puddles and streams of this miniature swamp are fed from the north,
where a spring-fed fountain gushes into a trickling stream.  The waters
spread out to cover much of the ground here, creating a muddy area, studded
with deep, murky puddles.  Only a few spindley gorse bushes grow from the
sodden ground, their small, yellow flowers doing little to liven the area. 

The puddles are fed from a broken fountain to the north, which burbles
between the western forest and the looming mansion to the northeast.  To the

Beneath the Southern Mansion Wall
  A path of white pebbles, muddy and overgrown, passes beneath the
southern-most wall of the mansion here.  The high stone wall is supported by
two elegant flying buttresses, which arch over the garden below.  Woodbine
and ivy, mottled red and green, cling thickly to the stonework, forming
great veils with sway in the wind beneath the arches.  The pebble path
continues east and west, while to the south an area of the garden has been
cleared.

  A weed-ridden path of white pebbles winds its way from the north, before

Veils of sprawling creeper, both red Nendorian woodbine and green ivy, drape
from a few ornamental elm trees, while completely shrouding several smaller
shrubs.  The garden continues in all directions but the east, where the wall
of an old, wooden building rises.

wall to the south, and sprawl over a dilapidated carriage house to the east,
their strangling tendrils stretching out toward the oak.  To the west the
ground seems to have been cleared somewhat.

The Entrance Hall
  Once splendidly appointed, this large entrance chamber is now in a state
of ruin and decay.  Wooden beams from the high, exposed roof hang
precariously from their sockets, now forming perches for the birds of the
forest, which come and go through the broken stained-glass windows. 
Girdling the southern half of the room is a wide balcony -- now unreachable,
as its wooden staircase has long since collapsed, blocking a door in the
eastern wall.  Several clocks, of different shapes and sizes, hang from the
plaster walls about the chamber, or lie toppled in the debris of the floor. 

Double doors are set in both the north and south walls, while in the western
wall the door has fallen from its hinges, and a faint, tinkling music comes

  A dark, ominous hallway leads north and south from here.  Its panelled
walls rise to a high, arched ceiling, which is thickly hung with dusty
cobwebs.  These cobwebs stir in the chill breeze, which blows from the
south.  The shadows are thickest in that direction, and seem to surround a
dark doorway at the end of the corridor.  A mounting dread builds with each
step toward that door.

The Grand Hallway
  A dark, brooding hallway leads south from here, and ends to the north in
a set of double doors.  The sense of deep foreboding seems to emanate from
the far end of the hall, which is concealed in dim shadow.  A chill breeze
wafts from that direction, stirring the thick cobwebs which hang from the

  Once splendidly appointed, this large entrance chamber is now in a state
of ruin and decay.  Wooden beams from the high, exposed roof hang
precariously from their sockets, now forming perches for the birds of the
forest, which come and go through the broken stained-glass windows. 
Girdling the southern half of the room is a wide balcony -- now unreachable,
as its wooden staircase has long since collapsed, blocking a door in the
eastern wall.  Several clocks, of different shapes and sizes, hang from the
plaster walls about the chamber, or lie toppled in the debris of the floor. 

Double doors are set in both the north and south walls, while in the western
wall the door has fallen from its hinges, and a faint, tinkling music comes
from the room beyond.

A Dusty Sitting Room
  The curving wall of the tower cuts through this room to the northwest,
giving it an odd, almost-triangular shape.  It is efficiently furnished as a
comfortable sitting room, with a couple of divans and a single armchair
arranged about the walls, all covered in dusty white sheets.  Against the
narrow segment of the northern wall, in the nook formed between the tower
and the eastern wall, is set a beautiful, gilded harpsichord.  A tinkling
music streams from the instrument, and its keys depress and rise again, as
though at the hands of an invisible musician.  

An open doorway leads to a large chamber to the east, and a closed doorway
to the south.

  Looming above you to the south is an old, stone mansion.  The building is
two stories high, with a tall bluestone tower set into the northwestern
corner. Most of this front face of the mansion is covered with thick ivy,
blending the building with the surrounding forest.  Only a few patches of
lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north
into the forest, turns east here, and disappears around the side of the
mansion. A set of heavy oak doors hang loose on their hinges to the south.

Beneath a Bluestone Tower
  A high bluestone tower rises from the northwest corner of the mansion,
just to your south.  Its jutting battlements perch well above the canopy of
the forest, some score feet higher than the decaying roof of the mansion. 
The tower itself seems to be in better repair than the rest of the mansion. 
Its dark, blue-grey stone is less weathered than the granite blocks of the
mansion proper, but more obviously - it seems to be free of the ivy which
shrouds the rest of the building.  The surrounding forest grows thickly up
to the western edge of the tower, also blocking travel to the north.  The
mansion's front door lies to the east.

A Rutted Carriageway
  A rutted carriageway winds north and south here, between the trees of
Nendor forest.  Once cobbled with flat, white stones, the path is now badly
overgrown.  The stones are now pushed askew by grasses and saplings, or lie
buried in the mud which crowds in from the edges.  The leafy boughs of the
tall, slender trees hang over the carriage-way, forming a light tunnel.  To
the north the path passes some old gate posts, while to the south the trees
give way, revealing an ivy-covered manor house.

By the Ivy-Covered Gate Posts
  The old carriageway continues south, passing between a pair of old,
stone gateposts.  The posts are of mortared bluestone blocks, roughly hewn,
and built into pinnacles some six feet high.  The gates themselves have long
since vanished, and all that remains of them are the heavy iron hinges,
bolted to the stone.  Thick ivy covers the gateposts, and the surrounding
shrubs almost completely obscure their presence.  To the south the path
continues through the trees, while on the northern side of the posts it
turns sharply west.

An Old Carriageway
  The thick corridor of juniper to the west ends suddenly as the old
carriageway turns southward.  Here, Nendor is a dense forest of leafy oak,
its floor hidden beneath fallen branches and sprawling undergrowth.  Just to
the south, a pair of ivy-decked, bluestone gate posts flank the rutted path.

  The faint trail to the south ends suddenly here, but not before it runs
into the remnants of an old carriageway.  This rutted track heads both east
and west from here, making a straight path through the deepening woods. 
From the thickness of the nettles and grass tussocks which stud the path,
and the occasional badger hole which breaches it, it would appear that the
carriageway hasn't been used in some time.

An Overgrown Trail
  A faint trail wanders through this breezy forest of oak and elm, turning

broadly spaced here, and a whistling wind plays between their trunks and
rustles in the green canopy overhead.

trail meanders through a forest of leafy oak and elm, occasionally vanishing
into the trunk of a tree, or a patch of thick undergrowth, before emerging
again some way further on, heading ever eastward.

inscribed with odd runic markings dot the side of the path every now and
again, standing on the border between road and forest.  Large oaks line the
path on either side, leaves casting shade upon the path below.  The singing
of birds echoes through the forest, providing a constant murmur of sound.  The
path runs south from the north, leading deeper into the forest.  To the
east and west, breaks in the thick treeline are visible.

Trail into the Forest
  This trail winds its way southward, through the downland south of Var
Bandor, toward the Forest of Nendor.  The edges of the dirt path are lined
with smooth stones.  Stony grassland spreads to either side beyond the chalk
stone border, and the Nendorin woods spread before you to the south.  Back
northward the walls of Var Bandor are still visible, albeit barely.

  The wooden docks of Var Bandor are arrayed to the west, bustling with
merchants, travelers, dockhands, and various other people.  The walls of the
city itself rise beyond the dock area, grand stone edifices designed to
protect the inhabitants of Var Bandor.  The river Aragol flows northward to
a junction.  Here, the pilings of the docks drive deep into the muddy bottom
of the water which swirls sluggishly along.  Large cleats are wound with
thick ropes for mooring, and filthy canvas fenders hang off the edges of the
docks.

Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the south is the central square of
Var Bandor.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

opposite side, the plains are broken by fields of high grass.  They bend and
weave with the winds.  Beyond the plains, there is a distant line of
mountains.

The Aragol River
  The river flows here at a gentle pace, burbling softly as it flows
northward.  Rocks and stones are visible through the crystal clear water,
only a few inches below its surface.  Wild woods and brambles of Nendor
forest rise along the steep banks of the river to the east and west,
preventing travel in either direction.  The river flows more quickly to the
north, while a large lake lies to the south.

you, which mark the beginning of the Aragol River to the north.  Jasa Lake
yawns before you to the south and east, its still surface rippling softly at
the breeze and reflecting the clouds, sun, and moon as they pass by.  The
rocks beneath the surface of the lake cause the beginning of the river to
gurgle merrily, and a few fish are visible darting about in the shallows.  A
small, sandy beach marks off the lake to the west, and is followed by a line
of trees.

  The water here is more still than that to the west, for this small pool
is almost entirely cut off from the body of the lake by a half-circle of
reeds.  The eerie stillness of the water's surface is broken only by
precipitation, and even then it seems reluctant to yield.  There is a break
in the wall of reeds to the south.  Eastward, a small path runs along the
rim of the pool, nearly buried in the towering plantlife.  A heavy wooden
pillar stands to the west, supporting a wooden platform, while the only exit
to the lake itself is through a small break in the reeds to the north.

A Dilapidated Hut
  The walls of this hut are almost entirely rotted through, bowing out near
the bottom.  A narrow window opens to the north, through which a number of
reeds have poked their tassled heads.  Little light filters into the room,
save from the doorframe to the west and a rather large hole in the northeast
corner of the roof.  Water drips from the hole in the roof, keeping the
uneven ground perpetually damp.  Reptilian footprints cover the mud in
small, water-filled craters, and a few body-shaped divots are sunk deep in
the mud in the northwest corner.  A boarded up door blocks passage to the
east.

Near a Dilapidated Hut
  The overgrown path to the east and south opens here before a seemingly
abandoned hut.  Originally much like the homes of Jaras Village to the
southwest, this hut seems to have been subjected to a number of floodings. 
Its walls bow out at the bottom, and the wood of the building is stained,
cracking, and mouldering all over.  The area around here looks as if it was
once part of the village but has been overrun with plants for many years.  A
number of reptilian footprints pock the mud, giving it an uneven appearance.
The doorless frame to the east leads into the hut, and a particularly dense
wall of reeds blocks passage to the north.  

[Exits: east south west]
     The mutilated heart of a young srryn is lying here.

An Overgrown Path
  The air here is thick and damp, giving a nearly tangible aura of humidity
to the locale.  The dirt here is tightly packed, much like that of the
village to the southwest.  What marks the difference between here and there,
however, is the abundance of tall plants that rise about you.  A few small
paths have been made through the plants, winding toward the north, west, and
south.  Two perilously molded buildings loom eastward, leaving only a small
space to pass between them.

Between Two Dilapidated Huts
  The pathway here appears perilous, for the huts to the north and south
appear highly unstable.  Each building bows out near its bottom, their
mouldering woods burdened by the weight of their hole marked roofs.  Each
wall has an unevenly-cut hole in itself, giving a view to the squalor
within.  The only means of exit from this precarious situation are to the
east, where a grassy knoll rises, and to the west, where your view is
obscured by plantlife.

A Rugged Marsh
  The ground here is covered with brush and thick bushes.  A few thin trees
stand tall near the south, casting patches of shade on the ground.  Tangled
bushes and thorny thickets grow close to the muddy ground, serving to make
passage on foot rather difficult.  A wall of thorns and tangled vines over
which the top of Mt.  Enrien is visible grows to the south, blocking
passage.  The tree covered marsh continues to the east.  The ground to the
north and west is far less unruly, its flora consisting more of tall reeds
than unruly woods.

break the tyranny of the low plantlife and lend a few swaying areas of shade
to the ground.  Woody brush grows all around in the form of tangled bushes,

A Rugged Marsh
  The marsh begins to turn into a forest here.  A single, thin tree stands
to the north and casts a gently swaying shadow on the ground.  Woody brush
grows all about in the form of tangled bushes, which serve to make passage
on foot quite difficult.  The bushes rise into a high thicket to the east,
effectively blocking passage.  A grass-covered knoll lifts itself from the
mud to the north, while the woody marsh continues southward.  The back of
a dilapidated hut stands, rotten and featureless, to the east.

<290hp 241m 201mv> A Grassy Knoll
  The ground rises to a knoll here, the top of which is covered with a
hard, dry, clay.  Relatively short grasses that sway with every breath of
wind grow around and on its crest.  A tree stands at the south end of the
knoll, heralding a more ruggedly woody terrain.  At the north end, the
ground dips downward and becomes thickly covered with plants.  A path is
westward, between two dilapidated houses.

Between Two Dilapidated Huts
  The pathway here appears perilous, for the huts to the north and south
appear highly unstable.  Each building bows out near its bottom, their
mouldering woods burdened by the weight of their hole marked roofs.  Each
wall has an unevenly-cut hole in itself, giving a view to the squalor
within.  The only means of exit from this precarious situation are to the
east, where a grassy knoll rises, and to the west, where your view is
obscured by plantlife.

An Overgrown Path
  The air here is thick and damp, giving a nearly tangible aura of humidity
to the locale.  The dirt here is tightly packed, much like that of the
village to the southwest.  What marks the difference between here and there,
however, is the abundance of tall plants that rise about you.  A few small
paths have been made through the plants, winding toward the north, west, and
south.  Two perilously molded buildings loom eastward, leaving only a small
space to pass between them.

An Overgrown Marsh
  This marsh looks as if it was once part of the village to the southwest,
but has been long since abandoned.  The trademark reeds of Jasa Lake revel
in their control of the land here, taking up more than their share of area. 
A few thin trails that are lined with reptilian footprints have been made
here, winding around some of the larger plants.  A path that appears to be a
convergence of these small trails winds away toward the north and west,

Syntax: Provoke
        Provoke all

This skill attempts to provoke others into combat with the user, traditionally
by insulting someone's mother but the skill does not specify and so one's
imagination may fly free. Using the 'all' argument will divert all ungrouped
combatants onto the user at once. Unlike rescue, one provokes the enemy, not
one's ally.

The brave trait will improve the chance of succeeding at this skill.

A Marshy Plot, Overrun by Reeds
  This area of the marsh is entirely covered by assorted grass, weeds, and
plantlife.  A few random stones are buried in the mud here, creating small
pockets of space where the plants do not intrude.  A small, ramshackle house
with a wild rosebush clinging to its mouldering surface stands to the east. 
The mass of plantlife here thins slightly to the north, giving way to a
small yet passable path.  The marsh continues southward.

  A veritable wall of reeds encircles this area, breaking in a number of
spots where footpaths have been tramped through them.  The ground is damp
yet well-packed, allowing a smooth yet slick passage for adventurers on
foot.  A few paths through the reeds branch off here, one leading toward the
lake northward and another heading toward a pair of ramshackle huts
eastward.  A path toward the village leads off to the west, while a wild
mass of plantlife is south of here.

A Half-Overgrown Path
  This path looks as if it has been used recently, but only to the lightest
extent.  Spiked weeds overrun the packed dirt here, giving the land an
overly inhospitable feel.  The air reeks of dampness and decay, the source
of which is the rotting house to the south.  A few vines clambor across the
side of the rotting house, appearing to be the only thing which holds them
together.  An overgrown path leads to the north and east, toward a pair of
broken-down huts.  Westward, a break in the reeds offers offers a view
toward a well-kept fishing village.

  The air here is thick and damp, giving a nearly tangible aura of humidity

village to the southwest.  What marks the difference between here and there
is the abundance of tall plants that rise about you.  A few small paths have

An Intersection of Overgrown Paths
  The air here is thick and damp, giving a nearly tangible aura of humidity
to the locale.  The dirt here is tightly packed, much like that of the
village to the southwest.  What marks the difference between here and there
is the abundance of tall plants that rise about you.  A few small paths have
been made through the plants, winding toward the north, west, and east.  The
plantlife grows wild to the south, yet appears to be passable.

  The overgrown path to the east and south opens here before a seemingly
abandoned hut.  Originally much like the homes of Jaras Village to the
southwest, this hut seems to have been subjected to a number of floodings. 
Its walls bow out at the bottom, and the wood of the building is stained,
cracking, and mouldering all over.  The area around here looks as if it was
once part of the village but has been overrun with plants for many years.  A

  The walls of this hut are almost entirely rotted through, bowing out near
the bottom.  A narrow window opens to the north, through which a number of
reeds have poked their tassled heads.  Little light filters into the room,
save from the doorframe to the west and a rather large hole in the northeast
corner of the roof.  Water drips from the hole in the roof, keeping the
uneven ground perpetually damp.  Reptilian footprints cover the mud in
small, water-filled craters, and a few body-shaped divots are sunk deep in
the mud in the northwest corner.  A boarded up door blocks passage to the

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

The River in the Tunnel
  The Dantaron River flows through a narrow tunnel at this point, with
barely room for two boats to pass one another.  The darkness is alleviated
by sunlight visible to the east and west ends of the tunnel, but vision is
still limited.

Forecastle of the Kkesiruant
  Sea spray bursts from below as waves crash into the bow of the
Kkesiruant.  Here on the forecastle, the brunt of wind and salt cuts into
any exposed flesh, and quickly soaks clothing.  The dark, triangular sails
provide some shelter as they noisily devour the wind.  The black foremast
towers above, and forward, the bowsprit lances through the spray.

Main Deck of the Kkesiruant
  The main deck of the Kkesiruant stretches before you, remarkably clean
and free of clutter.  While necessary supplies remain at hand, the cargo
seems stowed away elsewhere.  The forecastle deck rises to the north, its
towering foremast and lance-like bowsprit piercing the ocean air.  The rope
shrouds binding the masts and sails sway with the ship, and ratlines lead
upward into a maze of dark, fluttering canvas.  To the south, the main deck
continues toward the stern.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza

A Damp Cave
  The damp cave floor is slick with the water dripping from the ceiling and
walls. Fungus and slime molds contribute to the lack of friction underfoot.
The air is stale and musty.  The damp cave twists east and west.

A Damp Cave
  The winding cave splits into a four-way intersection, with one branch
twisting north and the other branches curving west, south, and east.  Water
drips from the ceiling, forming puddles on the cave floor, and the soft
earth that lines the cave floor to the south slowly fades to the north and
west.

A Damp Cave
  The damp cave winds its way north and south.  Moisture trickles down the
stone walls, and patches of fungus grow in red and brown patterns.  The soft
dirt of the cave floor is disturbed by occasional footprints.

The Mining Camp
  This stretch of cave is crowded with mining equipment, bedrolls for
several men, provisions, and various clutter.  Apparently this is the
temporary camp of a mining party.  Further evidence lies in mine shafts sunk
into the east and west walls of the cave, and mine carts partially filled
with ore.  The main cave continues north and south.

  The damp cave continues, leading into the darkness to the north, and

The Mouth of the Cave
  A gap in the face of the hill opens into a large cave.  The walls are
slick with condensed moisture and growths of fungus.  There is a musty air
to the natural passage that leads north.  Many footprints mar the soft dirt
of the cave floor, packing it into a regular path in some areas.

A Path to a Hill
  To the north, the path veers sharply toward a cluster of low foothills. 
An opening in the face of the nearest hill leads into a cavern, and to the
south, the lower foothills spread vastly.  Far in the distance, the peaks of
the Brintor Mountains tower above the horizon, a grand spectacle in the
background.

A Path Through the Foothills
  A small path formed by the recent passing of wagon wheels leads through
the foothills, sinking deeply into the earth of the foothills.  To the
north, the trail bends toward a group of foothills rising above the others. 
To the west, the trail returns toward the Brintor Road.

| Avendar, like most MUDs, uses colored text to help highlight what is     |
| happening during play.  This includes communication channels, damage     |
| dealt or received, and many other uses.  Regardless of your selection,   |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Human:     Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.      |
| Aelin:     Slight with feathered wings, known for their grace and pride. |
| Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.  |
| Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions. |
| Chaja:     Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns. |
| Ch'taren:  Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.       |
| Ethron:    Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.    |
| Nefortu:   Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.      |
| Shuddeni:  Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.       |
| Srryn:     Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.   |
|                                                                          |
| All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do   |
| not exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical      |
| maturity for their lineage, which may vary between species.              |
|                                                                          |
| Each lineage will have different innate traits (such as flight or        |
| darkvision) and a different spread of maximum statistics. For more       |
| information, including a table of max stats, see HELP STATISTICS.        |

|                                  Chaja                                   |
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Most chaja communities live in isolated strongholds in the Brintor       |
| mountains, ordering their lives by the stars.  Owing to this isolation,  |
| chaja are most widely known across Avendar for their use by the shuddeni |
| as slaves, particularly during the War of Night.  Chaja are caprine      |
| giants with wooly hair covering most of their bodies, uniformly pale     |
| eyes, and small, nubby horns.  They are nearly as tall as the alatharya, |
| but have rounder, softer bodies with little muscle definition.  Their    |
| size allows them to wield two-handed weapons in a single hand.  They     |
| can see in darkness, and may safely eat nearly anything.  For more       |
| information, read HELP CHAJA.                                            |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Human:     Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.      |
| Aelin:     Slight with feathered wings, known for their grace and pride. |
| Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.  |
| Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions. |
| Chaja:     Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns. |
| Ch'taren:  Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.       |
| Ethron:    Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.    |
| Nefortu:   Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.      |
| Shuddeni:  Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.       |
| Srryn:     Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.   |
|                                                                          |
| All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do   |
| not exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical      |
| maturity for their lineage, which may vary between species.              |
|                                                                          |
| Each lineage will have different innate traits (such as flight or        |
| darkvision) and a different spread of maximum statistics. For more       |
| information, including a table of max stats, see HELP STATISTICS.        |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Most chaja communities live in isolated strongholds in the Brintor       |
| mountains, ordering their lives by the stars.  Owing to this isolation,  |
| chaja are most widely known across Avendar for their use by the shuddeni |
| as slaves, particularly during the War of Night.  Chaja are caprine      |
| giants with wooly hair covering most of their bodies, uniformly pale     |
| eyes, and small, nubby horns.  They are nearly as tall as the alatharya, |
| but have rounder, softer bodies with little muscle definition.  Their    |
| size allows them to wield two-handed weapons in a single hand.  They     |
| can see in darkness, and may safely eat nearly anything.  For more       |
| information, read HELP CHAJA.                                            |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Human:     Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.      |
| Aelin:     Slight with feathered wings, known for their grace and pride. |
| Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.  |
| Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions. |
| Chaja:     Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns. |
| Ch'taren:  Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.       |
| Ethron:    Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.    |
| Nefortu:   Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.      |
| Shuddeni:  Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.       |
| Srryn:     Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.   |
|                                                                          |
| All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do   |
| not exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical      |
| maturity for their lineage, which may vary between species.              |
|                                                                          |
| Each lineage will have different innate traits (such as flight or        |
| darkvision) and a different spread of maximum statistics. For more       |
| information, including a table of max stats, see HELP STATISTICS.        |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Most chaja communities live in isolated strongholds in the Brintor       |
| mountains, ordering their lives by the stars.  Owing to this isolation,  |
| chaja are most widely known across Avendar for their use by the shuddeni |
| as slaves, particularly during the War of Night.  Chaja are caprine      |
| giants with wooly hair covering most of their bodies, uniformly pale     |
| eyes, and small, nubby horns.  They are nearly as tall as the alatharya, |
| but have rounder, softer bodies with little muscle definition.  Their    |
| size allows them to wield two-handed weapons in a single hand.  They     |
| can see in darkness, and may safely eat nearly anything.  For more       |
| information, read HELP CHAJA.                                            |

| during creation, which represents part of your character's training      |
| during their time in the School of Heroes.                               |
|                                                                          |
| You have five total points to spend on traits. Religion and god touch    |
| is the last step in character creation; please remember to keep 3 of     |
| your trait points if you desire a god touch. For a mechanical breakdown  |
| of each, please see HELP TRAITS and HELP GOD TOUCH.                      |

perpetually overcast sky.  Gilded symbols of the gods Dolgrael, Lilune, and
Jolinn have been lovingly sculpted into massive doors of dark basalt that
lock fast behind you.  There is no way back; only forward.  

Whether due to triumph or tragedy, a drive to desperate heroism or sadistic
villainy, you have come to this remote place and secured your adventurer's
license from the School of Heroes.  You have completed your official
training and registration and stand now before the Tower of Testing, where
your final practical examinations await you.  

You may leave through the portals connected to different towns on the
continent of Avendar in the Tower of Testing ahead, but you are encouraged
to proceed with your practical examination, as it will impart many valuable
skills and items for your life ahead.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Temple of Balance
  An ancient temple, this place is built in a magnificent style, calling to
mind the grandest stages of classical architecture in Earendam.  Gentle
stone steps lead across the south of the room to an altar of deep brown
marble.  Carved above the altar is the lemniscate, traditional symbol of an
ancient order of priests devoted to the forces of balance in the universe. 
On either side of the altar stand twin statues, one made from carved ivory,
the other of midnight-black onyx.  The chambers ends to the north, where a
high doorway leads out to the street.

Side Street
  Paved with cobblestones from the Brintors, this side street runs through
the old city, connecting Qalnistra Street to the west with the magnificent
Temple of the Crown, which lies eastward.  One building stands out along the
way here, magnificently built even for the architecture of the old city. 
Ivy grows across its marble pillars, and quartz steps lead into it to the
south.  Elsewhere, the backs of buildings loom over the north side of the
street, shading the cobblestones of the way.

marble tiles, so skillfully executed that it is difficult to find the seams
of the stone squares.  To the east, a broad stairway, its sixty-foot wide
steps inlaid with gold, rises gradually above the level of the street.  At

age, having carried the weights of both the traditions and the bodies of the
city's scholars and aristocrats for time immemorial.  Here, Qalnistra is

an Earendam's nobility.  Corvandil Square connects the two halves of the

gate.  Ringing the square are ornamental fountains, each inset in a corner

West Qalnistra Street
  Lined with the buildings which typify the styles and architecture of Old
Earendam, West Qalnistra leads west through the southern reaches of the
city.  Home to many of the city's scholars and clergy, Qalnistra serves to
connect the Corvandil Square and the South gates of Earendam to the east
with the temple of Jolinn further west.  Here, the north side of the street
allows entrance to the columned doorway of one of Earendam's banks. 
Meanwhile, up the marble stairs to the south sits the retreat of the Seekers
of Knowledge.

End of Qalnistra Street
  Qalnistra Street's western extent comes to an end here, halting in the
Earendam's colossal temple of Jolinn.  Marbles steps lead up, and to the
west, passing underneath pillars which are easily thirty paces high. 
Meticulously carved and cared for, the temple is devoid of the gold and
silver ornaments found in temples to other gods, but in the frieze above the
entranceway, the characters of the bas relief are lined with diamond, and
the center depicts the sapphire spear, symbolically represented by an
enormous sapphire.

Inside a Temple to Jolinn
  The interior of Earendam's temple to Jolinn is daunting in its size. 
Topped by a dome of bluish marble, the room is illuminated by the glass
oculus that breaks the surface of the roof.  Light reflects on the carved
mosaic in the floor, which depicts the precepts of Jolinn in shades of
sapphire and inlaid mother-of-pearl.  A rival even to Iandir's prevalent
religion in this city, Jolinn's temple is tended by an ancient group of
clergymen, and maintained by the city's wealthier patrons.  To the west, an
altar is set upon an illuminated dais, while alcoves lead north and south
out of this massive chamber.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the south is the central square of
Var Bandor.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

  Water churns through this shallow estuary as the relatively warm, fresh
water of the Fortfo River flows into the cold, salty tides of the Sea of
Lidreau.  Despite the water being only hip-deep at most, the currents are
powerful and unpredictable.  Seagrass sways beneath the surface, providing
hiding places for wildlife, and spike grass covers most of the sandy shore. 
Narrow paths run between makeshift driftwood bridges.  Banks of mist roll
through from the west, where a sandbar bears the brunt of Lidreau's might. 
To the north and east, the protected estuary continues.  The ground rises to
the south, becoming rockier, and the bright green discs of anemones can be

town of Gaald can be faintly heard on the wind.

  A sandy ocean shore stretches to the north and south, surrounding the
beaten path that travels parallel to the shoreline a ways to the west.  Few
if any remnants of the thick oak forests to the northeast remain, replaced
instead by pebbles, shale, and fallen boulders from the towering Yagash
mountains far to the east.  Far off to the southwest, a small peninsula juts
forth from the shoreline, and a small town sits atop it.  The path below is
deeply grooved and spotted with tracks of animals, people, and caravans of
goods, and stretches to the north and south.

beaten path that travels parallel to the shoreline far off to the west.  A
few small shrubs and grasses stray from the oak forest to the east, their
leaves rustling in the gentle oceanside winds.  Waves crash in the distance

  The towering gates of Var Bandor rise to the south.  Huge, heavy wooden
doors reinforced with iron bars, the gates are maintained rigorously.  The
walls to the east and west are solid stone, with murder slits.  To the
north, the river Dantaron splits into two mighty forks which flow by Var
Bandor on either side.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the east and west is a squalid

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between

ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the

  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor is generally shaped
like a cross, with two long intersecting hallways.  The floor here is the
same rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This hallway continues south, while the
stairwell to the first floor lies to the north.

The Splendid Temple of Ayaunj
  A wide balcony comprises the second level, ringed by a high balustrade
and overlooking both the massive Gaaldic chandelier and the busy atrium
below.  From here, religious murals are more clearly visible between the
ribs of the fan-vaulted ceiling.  Doors into smaller, more inexpensive
temporary offices and meeting rooms ring the floor, frequented by merchants
finalizing business deals and barrister-priests offering fast legal
services.

A large silver platter, etched with intricate filigree, comprises the
main surface of the Ayaunji altar.  Above it, a statue of the amber dragon
looms menacingly, its claws outstretched and its lips curled back as if
ready to unleash its famed electric breath.  Made of polished silver, the
dragon is decked with amber cabochons for scales, the silver backing giving
them a mirror-bright sheen, and sending golden glints about the temple.

Stiila Limchi is small for a nefortu, her dainty body covered with fine
snow-white hair.  Large pointed ears shading to sunny yellow near the tips
frame a round face with an upturned snout and large onyx-dark eyes.  Her
wings seem almost over-large for her slight frame, the effect emphasized by
the bangles and draping chains that chime gently with her every movement.  A
draping cloth-of-silver body wrap marks her as one of Ayaunj's
barrister-priests, while the sharktooth charm clasping it at the shoulder
suggests training in Lielqani rites.

  The grand atrium of the Splendid Temple of Ayaunj opens all sides, its
high fan-vaulted ceilings held aloft by fluted Gaaldic columns above a
resplendent golden marble floor, everything in sight glittering under a
massive, radiant Gaaldic chandelier.  Private offices and meeting rooms ring
the vast open floor on two tiers, rented by barrister-priests or visiting
merchants as they conduct every conceivable kind of business.  Spiraling
stairs lead up to the second tier and down to the basement, and guards
linger inconspicuously near every egress.

  This underground chamber is cool and dry relative to the open air of the
Gaaldic seaside.  No less exquisitely appointed than the upper floors, the
room is divided in half by a desk and wall of ornate silver bars, behind
which banking clerks count, sort, and exchange coins, transforming paper
into the precious metal so beloved by Ayaunj and Her priesthood.  Behind the
bustling clerks, the facade of both a vast vault and a guarded passage is
visible, secured by palpable auras of magic and divine power both.

marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

  The southern gatehouse of Var Bandor is an elaborate affair,
well-maintained and proper.  A close watch is kept on the kind of traveler
allowed to enter the finest districts of the city, and a roster of those
banned from the area is kept nearby.  The immense granite walls rise to
either side of the gates, and to the south, the outskirts of Var Bandor run

stone gateposts.  The posts are of mortared bluestone blocks, roughly hewn,
and built into pinnacles some six feet high.  The gates themselves have long
since vanished, and all that remains of them are the heavy iron hinges,
bolted to the stone.  Thick ivy covers the gateposts, and the surrounding
shrubs almost completely obscure their presence.  To the south the path
continues through the trees, while on the northern side of the posts it
turns sharply west.

buried in the mud which crowds in from the edges.  The leafy boughs of the

lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north

A Junk-Filled Storeroom
  The rear room of this caretaker's cottage has been converted to a storage
room for junk.  A few benches line the walls, and on these lie dozens of
gardening and carpentry tools, missing heads, handles, or simply rusting to
pieces.  Under the benches are stacked a large array of pots, buckets, and
barrels.  In one corner, surrounding an old cupboard, lies a pile of strange
mechanical devices - metallic frames crammed with cogs, levers and gears. 
Most seem to be broken, their former functions indecipherable.  

A single door leads to the west, to the main part of the cottage.

The Splendid Temple of Ayaunj
  A wide balcony comprises the second level, ringed by a high balustrade
and overlooking both the massive Gaaldic chandelier and the busy atrium
below.  From here, religious murals are more clearly visible between the
ribs of the fan-vaulted ceiling.  Doors into smaller, more inexpensive
temporary offices and meeting rooms ring the floor, frequented by merchants
finalizing business deals and barrister-priests offering fast legal
services.

The Splendid Temple of Ayaunj
  The grand atrium of the Splendid Temple of Ayaunj opens all sides, its
high fan-vaulted ceilings held aloft by fluted Gaaldic columns above a
resplendent golden marble floor, everything in sight glittering under a
massive, radiant Gaaldic chandelier.  Private offices and meeting rooms ring
the vast open floor on two tiers, rented by barrister-priests or visiting
merchants as they conduct every conceivable kind of business.  Spiraling
stairs lead up to the second tier and down to the basement, and guards
linger inconspicuously near every egress.

room is divided in half by a desk and wall of ornate silver bars, behind
which banking clerks count, sort, and exchange coins, transforming paper

are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens

The Foyer of the School of Heroes
  The School of Heroes begins with a grand foyer, complete with a vaulted
ceiling held aloft by great marble columns.  The room is spacious and airy,
with high, white marble walls and mounted, shining globes to provide light. 
Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's

It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by

still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's

The Bar in the Adventurer's Lounge
  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower
of Testing.  This space, however, is known as the Adventurer's Lounge, which
is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is arranged with chairs
and couches much like the rest, with a large, well-worn area rug in the
middle.  Notably, a well-polished bar stands against the south wall, and an
additional hallway leads to the east.  The lounge continues to the north and

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the

ancient stone walls.

The Beginning of the First Floor
  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
north, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill the
quiet air.

depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other

  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Temple of Balance
  An ancient temple, this place is built in a magnificent style, calling to
mind the grandest stages of classical architecture in Earendam.  Gentle
stone steps lead across the south of the room to an altar of deep brown
marble.  Carved above the altar is the lemniscate, traditional symbol of an
ancient order of priests devoted to the forces of balance in the universe. 
On either side of the altar stand twin statues, one made from carved ivory,
the other of midnight-black onyx.  The chambers ends to the north, where a
high doorway leads out to the street.

Side Street
  Paved with cobblestones from the Brintors, this side street runs through
the old city, connecting Qalnistra Street to the west with the magnificent
Temple of the Crown, which lies eastward.  One building stands out along the
way here, magnificently built even for the architecture of the old city. 
Ivy grows across its marble pillars, and quartz steps lead into it to the
south.  Elsewhere, the backs of buildings loom over the north side of the
street, shading the cobblestones of the way.

religion in this city, Jolinn's temple is tended by an ancient group of
clergymen, and maintained by the city's wealthier patrons.  To the west, an

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

The Wench's Lute
  This shop lies just off of the east end of Raddin Street, and is exactly
as dingy as one might expect for the surroundings.  One of the windows is
boarded over, and the other is made of bubbled, foggy glass.  An imitation
Harrudim rug covers most of the uneven floor, and a roughly made counter is
toward the east side of the room.  Instruments are mounted on the walls
along with dim lights, providing examples of the shop's wares.  A wooden
doorway leads west.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

Waitresses work their way through the crowd, stolidly ignoring the ogling of
the crowd of rowdy warriors.  The room is illuminated by cast iron lanterns,
which hang down from the ceiling on long chains, serving as a crude sort of
chandelier.  The inn stretches out in all directions, though more people
seem to be clustered about the bar to the south.

A Run-Down Weaponry
  This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling
is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop's unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

The Saurian Armory
  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop's north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air
of the city.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the

city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

Outside the Northern Gatehouse
  The towering gates of Var Bandor rise to the south.  Huge, heavy wooden
doors reinforced with iron bars, the gates are maintained rigorously.  The
walls to the east and west are solid stone, with murder slits.  To the
north, the river Dantaron splits into two mighty forks which flow by Var
Bandor on either side.

The Outskirts of Var Bandor
  You stand outside the north wall of Var Bandor.  In the distance to the
north, the Dantaron river splits into two forks which flow around Var Bandor
on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows
the outskirts.

A Ferry Station
  The waters of the Dantaron River flow placidly to the north, a muddy

has been erected at the water's edge, and several large ferries run by
riverfolk carry passengers back and forth between the Arien Road and the
outskirts of Var Bandor.

  A narrow strip of stones that leads north into the grasslands, the
Earendam Road was once heavily travelled by caravans trading with the
mountain outposts to the north.  It has since fallen into disuse, but is
still nominally maintained by Earendam.

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

Center of Tyril Square
  The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

East of Tyril Square
  The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The

stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.  

[Exits: north east south west down]

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

The Beginning of the First Floor
  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
north, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill the
quiet air.

  This stairwell is in the far northeast, just outside of the first floor

the stairs climb higher, the chill cling of the air lessens and the basement
scent dims.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing
the flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and
smooth, suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the
rat-infested first floor of the Tower of Testing, while the second floor

The Beginning of the Second Floor
  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor is generally shaped
like a cross, with two long intersecting hallways.  The floor here is the
same rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This hallway continues south, while the
stairwell to the first floor lies to the north.

The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor below, with high glass

the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never

stone of the lower levels toward white brick and tile, much like that of the
School of Heroes.  The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor
below, with high glass panels that follow the stairs as they proceed further
up.  From here you have a pleasant but commanding view of Avendar's distant
horizons, with vents letting in further fresh air from above.  The stairway
gets colder as it descends.

magic, but otherwise is entirely unencumbered.  It includes a large central
platform, upon which six slender spires rise, matching a convex hexagon's
points.  The golden staircase from below arrives between two of such spires,
allowing admission to the platform.  The glittering stone of the rooftop
shines in both sunlight and moonlight, and the shrill wind whips between the
spires.  The surrounding skyscape is above the clouds, their wispy expanse

  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens

Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.

  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower
of Testing.  This space, however, is known as the Adventurer's Lounge, which
is a large, open expanse.  It is filled with chairs, couches, and other
furniture, allowing students of the School to gather, converse, or join
together.  The walls are made older, darker stones than the floor above, but
are lit by similar iron sconces.  The floor is hardwood, rather than tile,
to dampen the clatter of steps.  The lounge continues to the north and east,

It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's
interior lies east, while the lounge is to the west.

  This spur off of the Adventurer's Lounge leads to a tremendous archway. 
It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's
interior lies east, while the lounge is to the west.  

A small note is tacked to the archway.

The Bar in the Adventurer's Lounge
  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower
of Testing.  This space, however, is known as the Adventurer's Lounge, which
is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is arranged with chairs
and couches much like the rest, with a large, well-worn area rug in the
middle.  Notably, a well-polished bar stands against the south wall, and an
additional hallway leads to the east.  The lounge continues to the north and
west, its high, pale stones and well-lit accommodations inviting students to
linger.  Far to the north is the entrance to the Tower of Testing.  

A small sign sits on the end of the bar.

eventually make their fortunes.  To the west and south, the lounge

School's lower facilities, are made of old, rough-hewn stone.  A hanging
banner informs students of where the stairs lead, and provides a splash of
color to an otherwise dark and grey passage.  Footsteps echo here, and the
cool air carries with it the musty scent of an ancient basement.  To the

are lit by similar iron sconces.  The floor is hardwood, rather than tile,
to dampen the clatter of steps.  The lounge continues to the north and east,

Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.

  The spiral stairwell rises up into a three-way junction, its cloudy glass
central column rising to the ceiling.  The stones here are older and more
rugged, suggesting that this portion of the School is older than the ground
level.  The vaulted ceiling is made from the same dark, elder stone as the
walls, with the tile floor worn from age.  From here, doors lead to the
north, east, and west.  The eastern door is made of untarnished gold which
glitters in the magical light of the chamber.  The west door is made from a

stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  These scattered wooden tables are filled by warriors, come to the tavern
for its reknowned mead.  Most of the people seated here seem to be grizzled
campaigners - mainly footman and the occasional pikeman from Var Bandor's
standing guard.  The rest of the tavern lies off to the west and south.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

A Dingy Office
  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

A Small Dirt Path
  This dirt path leads out of the hilly freehold to the flat river plain
near Var Bandor.  It appears well-trodden by people and animals of all
descriptions, particularly geese.  Wagon ruts give some sign of the commerce
between the farms and the city, bringing crops and honey to the river
traffic running between Var Bandor and Earendam.  Though the woods encroach
upon the path to the east and west, it is easily passable to the north and
south.

At the Bottom of a Low Hill
  The ground begins sloping upwards to the west here, with more rocks
visible pushing to the surface.  The chalky pebbles seem to choke off the
plant life to some extent, but a fair amount of grass and shrubbery still
appears able to thrive.  Westwards, the slope continues upwards to a chalk
ridge, while a stand of mature aspen trees grows in the more fertile soil to
the south.  An outdoor shrine lies to the east, and a dirt path follows a
barely-perceptible downwards slope to the north.

A Small Shrine on a Hill
  A circle of standing stones rings the top of this small hill, the chalky
rock cut into even blocks about seven feet tall.  The terrain is gentle,
rolling hills slowly descending into the muddy shallows of Jasa Lake far to
the south, and to the Dantaron River to the north.  A small copse of trees
is visible to the southwest.  Within the circle, a small altar sits at the
feet of a simple statue.  A gurgling fountain pours into a pool about the
statue, and several small fruit trees have been planted next to some of the
standing stones.  A feeling of peace and safety permeates the area. 
Pathways lead out of the circle in all directions.

The End of a Shallow Valley
  Rising gently from the north, the valley ends here with only a vague
depression compared to the surrounding terrain.  The ground is host to a
sparse covering of grass, struggling to survive in the poor soil.  Flakes of
chalk litter the ground, fragile enough to break under even a light
footstep.  To the west, standing stones form a ring around a statue.  The
terrain continues its rise to the south, culminating in a low hill.

A Low, Grassy Hill
  This low, grassy hill is part of a long rise which ripples the terrain of
the Lithling Freehold.  Tough green grass grows in patchy swaths along the
hillside, stretches of chalky white stone showing through in many places.  A
white boulder of the same stone crowns the top of the hill here.  The rise
continues levelly to the north.  To the east and west the land dips sharply.

A Flowery Meadow
  This small field occupies a depression in the surrounding hills. 
Shielded from the sometimes-harsh winds through the hills, it has proven a
fertile environment for all manner of delicate flowers.  The rolling terrain
prevents you from looking very far in any direction, but treetops are
visible all around.  The meadow opens through a shallow gap between a pair
of hills to the east.

A Gap Between a Pair of Hills
  Between the hills to your north and south, this gap has formed a sort of
pass extending from a meadow to the west up to the top of a low ridge to the
east.  The wind is focused through this gap, eroding the soil to such a
degree that very little remains, with exposed rocks and gravel covering the
ground.  It is possible to pick your way over the rocks to the south.

A Grassy Hill
  This hill is covered with long, tenacious prairie grass, bending low with
each gust of the wind.  Geese can be seen and heard moving through the
grass, hunting for seeds.  The ground here is surprisingly firm, perhaps
owing to the density of grass roots just beneath the surface.  To the north
is a gap between this hill and the next, while the hill slopes away to
flatter land to the east and south.

A Muddy Depression
  Jasa Lake is only a short distance to the south, and appears to be
encroaching on the soil.  Stagnant, boggy water conspires with the masses of
decaying plants to generate a thoroughly unpleasant smell and swarms of
annoying flies.  The ground rises to firmer, drier heights to the north and
west, while the truly waterlogged beach of Jasa Lake is south.

  A small beach is here, its thick brown sand almost entirely saturated
with water.  Footprints of both animals and recently-passed travellers are
sunk into the wet sand, here, forming tiny lakes of their own.  The beach
itself is low-lying, only barely venturing above the level of water within
the lake itself.  To the south, the beach slips beneath the waters into the
shallows.  Westward, the water of the lake gurgles softly as it flows into
the Aragol River.

The Shallows of Jasa Lake
  The water here is no more than a foot and a half deep.  The ground
beneath the water is clearly visible through the shimmering water, lined
with a layer of smoothed stones and pebbles.  A few cast off leaves float on
the surface of the water.  Amphibious reeds and marsh grasses grow from the
small beach that cradles the shallows to the north and east.  The body of
the lake expands outward to the west and south.

  Flat and pristine, the clear waters of Jasa Lake stretch out before you. 
With a clear view to the sky, the air here becomes warm during the daytime
and provies an expansive scene of the stars by night.  Small disturbances in

platform of wood above your head.  Nearly as thick as a full-grown tree, the
wooden column shows very few signs of rot.  A high water mark is visible a

In a Fishing Village
  Looping around the side of a fishing hut, the mud and clay path here is
very well-defined against the wild grasses and reeds which grow further to
the east.  Bordered by the pebble-covered beach to the north, the small road
appears as if it was made by the earth itself rather than by the feet of
men.  A myriad tall grasses rise to the south, all but covering the deeply
chipped whitewash of the hut which lies beyond.  A glassless window peeps
through the grass on the hut's wall, about at the height of a human's head. 
The path continues westward toward the village, while it appears to sink

  Within the village, the aura of laziness is nearly palpable.  Little
activity happens here, and the houses which surround Jaras Square to the
north seem to stare longingly at it.  Here, the lack of activity is somewhat
bleak.  A few weeds have burst through the hard-packed mud and clay of the
ground, and the silky fuzz of grass that has sprouted looks like it has been
trampled recently.  The mud and clay give way to a sunken patch of marsh to
the south, while the village continues north, east, and west.

footprints, most of which have been made by birds and other small animals. 
Flowering plants cover the uneven ground, yet a number of reeds are still
present, towering above them.  The reeds grow more thickly to the north and
east.  Reeds dominate to the south, where the ground curves downward

  The plantlife grows so thickly here that it is difficult to pass through
it without creating a large amount of rustling noise.  Standing nearly eight
feet in places, the reeds have become a home to many animals, as can be seen
by the slither marks and small footprints left in the mud, and the sounds
that seem to come from some ambient source.  The reeds thin a little to give
way to brambles eastward, where a few trees loom.  The marsh continues as it
is here to the west, toward the body of the lake, while a small path is
barely visible through the growth to the north.

A Rugged Marsh
  The ground here is covered with brush and thick bushes.  A few thin trees
stand tall near the south, casting patches of shade on the ground.  Tangled
bushes and thorny thickets grow close to the muddy ground, serving to make
passage on foot rather difficult.  A wall of thorns and tangled vines over
which the top of Mt.  Enrien is visible grows to the south, blocking
passage.  The tree covered marsh continues to the east.  The ground to the
north and west is far less unruly, its flora consisting more of tall reeds
than unruly woods.

A Rugged Marsh
  The marsh begins to turn into a forest here.  A single, thin tree stands
to the north and casts a gently swaying shadow on the ground.  Woody brush
grows all about in the form of tangled bushes, which serve to make passage
on foot quite difficult.  The bushes rise into a high thicket to the east,
effectively blocking passage.  A grass-covered knoll lifts itself from the

by the slither marks and small footprints left in the mud, and the sounds
that seem to come from some ambient source.  The reeds thin a little to give
way to brambles eastward, where a few trees loom.  The marsh continues as it

Through the gates to the south, the sounds of bustling commerce from the

A Trail to the Lighthouse
  This trail is quite old; the earth is packed solid from countless years
of footsteps.  Heavy stones have been pounded into it, providing a path
which would survive the frequent rain of the Gaald peninsula.  To the south,
the ivy-covered granite walls of the city guard its edge, while the walls of
Corvalius Manor protect the estate to the north.  A persistent sea-breeze
rolls through the corridor, bringing with it the smell of surf and salt.  A
well-worn road waits to the east, while it continues west toward the ocean.

A Well-Trod Path
  The gates to the port city of Gaald are an iron-wrought work of artistry
that seem more for show than defense, featuring a stylized eagle over a
ship.  The thick granite frame and walls are encroached upon by ivy.  To the
north and east, a well-worn path curves along the outskirts of the city,
equidistant from the walls and the rocky shoreline of the Gaald peninsula. 
Through the gates to the south, the sounds of bustling commerce from the
trader houses and markets can be heard.  A less-used trail leads west, while
a sprawling estate can be spotted past tall fieldstone walls to the north.

A Well-Trod Path
  A broad stone wall, half-overgrown with clinging ivy, encircles the small
port city of Gaald.  This wide, wheel-rutted path runs parallel to the wall,
keeping equal distance between the wall and the rocky shore of the
peninsula.  A few lonely cypress trees stand here and there between the path
and the shoreline, with tall brown grasses and squat, yellow-flowered gorse
bushes providing little cover.  To the west, the path leads to the northern
gates of the city.

A Turn on a Well-Trod Path
  The path rises slightly here as it curves around the outskirts of the
port city of Gaald.  The increased elevation allows a glimpse, beyond the
wall, of the dark-tiled roofs of homes, shops, and trading houses.  Far in
the distance to the west, beyond the city, a lighthouse rises from a small
stony point, a lit beacon shining from its heights.

  Running between an ivy-overgrown wall and the rocky shoreline of the
Gaald peninsula is this broad wheel-rutted path.  A large, limb-twisted
cypress stands on one side of the path, a tall thin pine on the other.  The
dull roar of the rolling waves breaking on the dark rocks of the shore is an
ever present noise.  To the north, the path makes a gradual curve to the

caravan wagons have left a double line of brown wheel ruts that cut through
the sparse grasses.  Seabirds call in the distance, above the low murmuring
of the waves, and the air is heavy with the tang of salt and the moisture of
sea spray.

The Entrance to the Forest
  A wealth of shrubbery and undergrowth to the east suddenly gives way to a
wall of towering oak trees, their vast, leafy branches forming a green
ceiling to the wooded area.  Sunlight is filtered out, for the most part,
and shadows dominate the area.  A slight breeze whispers through the leaves
in the uppermost portions of the oaks.  A small dirt road leads into the
forest to the west, and out of the forest to the east.

A Path Through the Plains
  An old track winds northward across the vast Arien Plains.  This
ill-travelled path is little more than a shallow depression in the clayish
earth, grown now with the sparse brambles and spiny tussocks which stud the
flatlands.  A pale, twisting thread, the track can be seen meandering for
miles before being engulfed in the unchanging greyness of the land.  The
track ends to the south, where it meets a dirt road which cuts the plains
from east to west.  Beyond this road in the distance, a silvery-blue ribbon,
the Dantaron River arcs northward to meet Var Bandor, whose walls can be
seen far to the southeast.

Approaching a Forest
  As the land rises to the north, the plains abandon their level march and
roll like great grassy dunes.  Each rounded rise is capped with small
growths of oak, smattered with red-berried rowan.  The ground grows more
rugged and forested to the north, and little rivulets flow from the higher
land, disappearing amidst reedy marshes in the shallow valleys.  To the
south the plains flatten and stretch away endlessly.

becoming mixed with tall-growing white birch.  To the south the land drops

The Bar at the Inn
  A long bar stretches from the eastern wall, and is lined with stools
where locals sit and discuss all the important village issues.  Beer flows
almost continuously from a pair of large kegs against the east wall.  A
narrow set of steps against the northern wall lead up to a trapdoor in the
roof.  To the north a small doorway leads outside.

The Charcoal-burner's Yard
  From the soot-stained wall of a stone house to the north, to the
impinging oak forest to the south stretches a long muddy yard.  A spire of
thick, grey smoke rises from a structure in the center of the yard, and
breaks into a helical plume as it reached the high breezes over the village.
The occasional gust of wind down from the forest canopy sends smoke swirling
about the yard.  The source of the smoke is a high mound, built in the
center of a broad, shallow depression.  The mound is covered in earth, but
at its base the inner structure of the mound can be seen - layer upon layer
of wooden logs.  Heat radiates from the entire mound, and the wood at the
base is blackened and charred.  Against the wall of the house, beneath a
narrow shelter, hang large, bulging, burlap sacks.  A wooden door leads
north into the house.  To the west, over a tumbled down fence, the forest
has overtaken the neighbouring yard.

  The tanner's yard is cluttered with all sorts of junk.  From the tanner's

Beneath this canopy, protected from the elements, sit three large vats of
foul smelling substances.  Newly tanned leathers hang above the vats, drying
in the breeze.  Benches, tools, building materials and an overturned
wheelbarrow are scattered about haphazardly.

  From the soot-stained wall of a stone house to the north, to the
impinging oak forest to the south stretches a long muddy yard.  A spire of
thick, grey smoke rises from a structure in the center of the yard, and
breaks into a helical plume as it reached the high breezes over the village.
The occasional gust of wind down from the forest canopy sends smoke swirling
about the yard.  The source of the smoke is a high mound, built in the
center of a broad, shallow depression.  The mound is covered in earth, but
at its base the inner structure of the mound can be seen - layer upon layer
of wooden logs.  Heat radiates from the entire mound, and the wood at the
base is blackened and charred.  Against the wall of the house, beneath a
narrow shelter, hang large, bulging, burlap sacks.  A wooden door leads
north into the house.  To the west, over a tumbled down fence, the forest
has overtaken the neighbouring yard.

the boles of some of the larger oaks, but otherwise little undergrowth

A Wooden House
  This run-down old house of wood and stone seems comfortable enough
inside.  A small bed stands unmade against one wall, and a couple of wooden
stools stand squat by a stone hearth.  A well blackened kettle hangs over a
small pile of smouldering coals and ash, steaming gently.  Next to the
hearth in the northern wall is a large wooden box for firewood.  Windows set
in the south and east walls reveal the thick forest outside, which presses
in against the little cottage.  In the western wall is set a door.

<359hp 188m 215mv> A Forest Path
  A narrow path winds amongst the tall red oak and tangled alder is it
makes its way deeper into the valley to the west, and up toward its rim to
the east.  The rocky ground becomes smooth and earthy as the path descends. 
A constant chirping and twittering comes from the canopy above, and half
seen movements betray the scurryings of small animals amongst the scatterd
undergrowth.  

[Exits: east west]

<359hp 188m 214mv> 
e
A Forest Path 
  The narrow path forms a wide curve through a forest of red oak and
tangled alder as it descends into a broad, shallow valley to the northwest,
and up over the valley's rim to the south.  Verdant mossy veils and
colourful toadstools cover the large grey boulders which litter the woods. 
Raucous chirping comes from the canopy above, and the occasional feathery
silhouette can be seen darting amongst the branches.

s
A Forest Path 
  A winding path drops away into a broad, shallow valley to the northwest. 
Thickly forested in ash, oak and alder, the valley's canopy shimmers in hues
of silver, rusty red and green.  The canopy curves upward again to darker
forests several miles away.  Thin blue-grey streams of smoke rise from the
western part of the valley.  To the south the path descends through a
rolling woods of white birch, riddled with tumbling streams.  

[Exits: north south]

<359hp 188m 212mv> 
s
A Forest Path 
  The narrow path winds over low ridges and through narrow valleys, rising
gently northward into thicker forest, and dropping away southward to the
forest eaves.  Granite outcrops break the land further, and the forest here
takes on a silvery sheen as white birch trees cluster upon low hillocks and
line the banks of swift rivulets which tumble their way southward.

<359hp 188m 211mv> 
The Eaves of a Forest
  The land here forms a tight network of shallow valleys and ridges,
channelling little rivulets into the flattening plains to the south.  The
trees grow more densely as the land rises to the north, the oak and rowan
becoming mixed with tall-growing white birch.  To the south the land drops
away, and the trees thin into scattered coppices upon the hilltops.  

[Exits: north south]

s
Approaching a Forest
  As the land rises to the north, the plains abandon their level march and
roll like great grassy dunes.  Each rounded rise is capped with small
growths of oak, smattered with red-berried rowan.  The ground grows more
rugged and forested to the north, and little rivulets flow from the higher
land, disappearing amidst reedy marshes in the shallow valleys.  To the
south the plains flatten and stretch away endlessly.

A Path Through the Plains
  An old track winds north and south across the vast Arien Plains.  This
ill-travelled path is little more than a shallow depression in the clayish
earth, grown now with the sparse brambles and spiny tussocks which stud the
flatlands.  A pale, twisting thread, the track can be seen meandering for
miles before being engulfed in the unchanging greyness of the land.  The
plains meet the sky at the horizon far to the east and south.  To the north
and west, dark lines border plain and sky, where the great forests lie.

The Center of Arien Plaza
  The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

The West Gate of Earendam
  Earendam's west gates are made of sturdy iron, built between two tall
stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
cultures, and/or aesthetics.  Please see the relevant help files and the
wiki for more information.  

Updates to our in-game help files to accurately represent added skills,
spells, and other mechanical changes are in progress.  In the mean time,
please check out our website or direct any questions to our Discord.  

Thanks for playing with us, we hope you have fun.

arriving or leaving the city.  To the east, the granite walls of Earendam
tower above the dock area.  Several ladders and wooden walkways lead

on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows

Outside the Northern Gatehouse
  The towering gates of Var Bandor rise to the south.  Huge, heavy wooden
doors reinforced with iron bars, the gates are maintained rigorously.  The
walls to the east and west are solid stone, with murder slits.  To the

Bandor on either side.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

monastery.  The buildings are tall, but below the mighty Nendorin canopy;
the proper size and sprawl of the complex is not apparent further west.  The
trees give way to long, thick grasses which encroach on the smooth cobbles
of the path and peek between some of its stones.  Wooden posts sporting
bronze enclosures are sparse, but provide enough light to make the way
visible even at night.  The air is fragrant and wild, the scents of the
forest and its creatures drifting upon it.  To the north is the entrance to
the monastery complex, while the uneven path continues west.

At the Wooden Gates
  Twelve feet tall and worked from Nendorin oak, the complex's entrance
maintains a careful balance between secure and welcoming.  The stone of the
monastery's central enclosure rises a few feet above the top of the
woodwork, its interior wildlife pushing at is boundaries.  From here, the
high, sloped roof rises prominently, revealing the monastery's split
eastern-western design.  The forest air is sweet, the faint breath of lilies
in its rich undertone.  A dirt path leads south back toward the forest,
while the monastery's famous sanctuary lies to the north.

An Enclosed Sanctuary
  The beginning of the monastery's miraculous sanctuary is a half-circle of
cobbled stones, giving definitive close to the road which led up to it. 
Here, the wondrous variety of the Qali clan's druidic mastery is more than
apparent; tall pines, spidery lowland trees, elms, beeches, and wide
goldenrain leaves are all visible.  The earth underfoot is dark and fertile,
partially concealed by a stretch of white rose bushes.  Stones bearing
ancient druidic markings are dug into the soil here and there, bending the
local climate to what suits the diverse array of flora.  The air is a wash
of scents, from stone, to moss, to salt, to swamp mist, to blooming flowers.
A meandering cobbled path leads through the wildlife, directing visitors
north, while smaller bare stretches lead east and west.

A young, brown-skinned ethron looks about the monastery at its variety of

carefully shape or enhance the plant-life around her.  Content, she moves
with reverence throughout the sanctuary and the garden in silence.  Wearing
monastery robes, it is likely that her training is in the hands of Eliqali,
the keeper of the clan.

The Sanctuary's Heart
  At the heart of the monastery is a bounteous grove, cultivated by both
druidic ritual and centuries of meticulous tending.  The plot is roughly
circular, the earth richer and darker than one would expect for the region. 
From it grow a thick cover of ever-blooming white lilies, split only by a
meandering cobbled footpath.  In the grove's center, a spectacular living
sculpture depicts a young caladaran girl, shaped entirely from carefully
bent saplings.  The air is alive with fragrance, capturing some essential,
foreign spirit in its headiness.  The sanctuary continues in all directions,
halting only when it reaches the walls of its stone enclosure.

mastery of druidic runestones is rivaled only by Avendar's most famous
hierophants.  A daughter of clan Qali, she was born and raised on monastery
grounds, training with the elder matrons as a teenager and traveling as a
young adult.  After returning home, she vowed to the All-Mother that she
would spend her life here, making certain that the wondrous legacy of her
ancestors would endure.

  To the north of the sanctuary's enclosure is the local garden, which
provides a small portion of the monks' food.  Vegetables are planted in
orderly rows, the dark earth fertile enough for an impressive yield relative
to their size.  The footprints of residents mark out paths between the rows,
and a small surrounding fence keeps forest denizens mostly at bay.  Unlike
other sections of the monastery exterior, there are no lanterns along the

one.  Although she has never made expressly clear what directed her to this

her to the waking world.  Her vast intelligence and curious fugue made her

A Well-Stocked Dry Storage
  Connected to the monastery kitchen is a storage area, meant to hold dry
or immediate supplies for its cook.  Jars of preserved fruit, strings of
hanging herbs, sacks of flour, and other necessities are all present within
its confines.  The northern wall has the largest shelves, which stand about
eight feet high; the southern counterpart is about four, allowing room for a
blurry glass window above it.  The floor is scuffed but swept clear, as this
is the most direct route from the kitchen to the monastery cellar.  While
the scent of meals lingers in the air, the bite of dry herbs and the dull
tone of flour temper it.  To the west is the kitchen proper, while the
cramped stairwell to the underground lies east.

  The small spur off of the western section of the monastery is cramped,
barely wide enough for two people to pass each other in it.  Despite leading
to the complex's earthen cellar, the well-worn floor is swept meticulously
clear of dirt or debris.  The ceiling here is a bit low, suggesting that
this hall was a late addition to the construction.  One small window, set at

An Ancient Cellar
  The cellar is by far the oldest part of the monastery, dating back to its
inception at the close of the War of Night.  It is dank, the walls cut from
the dark earth of Nendor and supported by stone and ancient, treated timber.
The floor is bare, packed dirt, save the uncharacteristic stone steps that
lead down to it.  Here, the locals store whatever needs to remain cool;
large barrels of beer from Eril, crates of extra clothing, and stores of wax
and lamp oil included.  The air is cool, close, and heavy, smelling of rich
earth and timeless stone.  The cellar continues north, while the monastery
proper waits above.

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  To the east, Arcanos Street leads to the scholars' towers.

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
east is Sadrent Road.

Leather Shop
  A thin layer of dust is visible throughout this building, which clearly
was once a leather shop of some sort.  Bare hooks line the walls, where once
merchandise must have hung.  An old counter sits near the back, emptied and
dusty.  A small sign tacked up to the wall indicates that the prior owner
was forced to close shop due to a family emergency, and that there is no
planned date of re-opening.  To the north, you can hear the sounds and
bustle of Iron Street.

A Brightly-Lit Shop
  A fortune's worth of glass fronts this shop, its meticulous frosting
obscuring the dreary cobbles of Iron Street.  A fireplace set into the side
wall wards off the damp and fills the room with a fragrant pine scent;
enough to mute the acrid tinge from the tannery next door.  Thin stone
columns support the raised ceiling, making this building taller than those
around it.  Above, a massive and opulent golden chandelier lights the shop,
its smoke and those of the steel sconces about the room darkening the roof's
wooden beams.  At the back of the store is a low, wide counter, providing an
easy work surface for final clothing alterations.

Some are being heated over huge furnaces, just turning the yellow-orange

dump their contents into cast molds.  Hissing and the ringing of metal on
metal assault your ears as finished casts are being thrust into barrels of

The Wheelwright's
  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

  Inside the gates, a paved cobblestone street leads through the town of

Night general.  The road itself is surprisingly clean, likely due to the
mountain wind catching the dirt and debris from both caravans and the boots
of travelers.  Stone buildings with high, sloped roofs line the street,
their heavy wooden doors keeping out the cool, fickle breeze.  What plants
are visible are mostly squat shrubs that grow stubbornly in the rocky soil.

The Gallery of Heroes
  The ceiling for the base floor of the tower extends nearly twenty feet
into the air, supported by dark stone columns.  Orbs of smokeless orange
light, high above, are mounted upon the pillars, casting their light
throughout the floor.  Set into the nearby pillar is an oil painting of the
renowned healer, Iliraya.  A golden plaque beneath it describes her role
during the War of Night.  The tile floor is well-swept, and the air is still
with reverence.  The Gallery of Heroes continues to the south, with a large
monument directly north.

An Entrance to the High Tower
  A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the north, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain
wind whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The
path continues east and west, while to the south, another path branches off
to the practice fields and schools.  To the north, a large door leads into
the keep itself.

The Southern Path
  Large, wooden barricades line the southern path, ensuring that the
training areas for the Kor Thrandian soldiers and archers remain both
contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible
beyond the barricades.  To the north, the keep of Kor Thrandir dominates the
skyline.

  The barricades which line the southern path open up here, allowing
entrance to the training grounds of Kor Thrandir.  Grunts of exertion, as
well as the clack of practice weapons and the snap of bowstrings, form a low
din which persists at nearly all hours.  The scents of practice, as well as
those of the trampled grasses and mountain wind, mix alternatingly with the
passing of the breeze.  To the west, young Thrandian soldiers practice their
martial skills, while to the east is the archery range.  The path continues

The Gate to the Archery Range
  The gate to the archery range sits open, propped in that position by a
large rock.  The heavily-tread path to the west gives way to wild grasses,
which are trampled low by the passage of Kor Thrandir's archers.  There are
no trees within the range itself, leaving plenty of open space for target
practice and preparation.  Wooden barricades surround the field, separating
it to keep most of the arrows in.  The wind is light and surprisingly clear,
with the sounds of snapping bows and striking arrows drifting upon it.  The
field begins to the north, while the main path lies to the west.

head shaved and face reddened from exposure.  He has a prominent scar over
one eye, which he received in the defense of the keep during the Eyeblight
War.  He has a notorious reputation for his rigorous exercise regimen and
no-excuses attitude, which made him a favorite of the Lord Protector.  He

A Small Rise on the Training Grounds
  From atop this small hill, the entire expanse of the training grounds is
easily visible.  It is from here that the field commander calls out orders,
admonishes soldiers, or signals the beginning and end of the training day. 
The grass here is longer and significantly less trampled than elsewhere,
some tiny, stubborn wildflowers peeking out amidst it.  The breeze is more
noticeable from here, coming down off of the Brintors, and the various
sounds of practice are more muted than below.  To the north and east, the
training grounds stretch out.

those of the trampled grasses and mountain wind, mix alternatingly with the
passing of the breeze.  To the west, young Thrandian soldiers practice their
martial skills, while to the east is the archery range.  The path continues
south into a cobbled courtyard, and north toward the keep.

The Southern Path
  Large, wooden barricades line the southern path, ensuring that the
training areas for the Kor Thrandian soldiers and archers remain both
contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible
beyond the barricades.  To the north, the keep of Kor Thrandir dominates the
skyline.

into the air, supported by dark stone columns.  Orbs of smokeless orange
light, high above, are mounted upon the pillars, casting their light
throughout the floor.  Set into the nearby pillar is an oil painting of
General Kalyius, leader of the Army of the Golden Hand.  A golden plaque
beneath it describes his personal heroism.  The tile floor is well-swept,
and the air is still with reverence.  Heavy wooden doors lead both to the

The Monument to the Lord Protector
  At the center of the base floor of the tower is a huge bronze monument. 
Standing over ten feet tall, it depicts an enormous human warrior plunging a
sword into a fallen shuddeni's chest.  The heavy stone pillars form a ring,
encircling the monument.  Mounted orbs of smokeless orange light are placed
high upon the pillars, bathing the statue in a permanent glow.  The tile
floor is well-swept, and the air is still with reverence.  The four halls

An Entrance to the High Tower
  A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the south, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain
wind whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The
path continues east and west, while to the north, another path branches off
to the barracks, mess hall, and infirmary.  To the south, a large door leads
into the keep itself.

About five feet tall, Rhuidar Neloneus is a famous ethron druid of the
Brintor Mountains.  He has long, brown hair and a similarly long beard,
framing his pleasant but unremarkable face.  His skin is a pale green, and
shows the weathering of the elevation's cold wind.  Born in the mountains,
he earned a notable reputation by foiling the plans of shuddeni slavers. 
His presence was welcomed by Lord Protector Malyn, who hailed him as a hero,
and he has since remained within Kor Thrandir.  He spends much of his time
tending his garden, stirring life amidst the stones.

scholars when the dread magic of Gyel'Xan spirited away the Titans of Castle
Nathli.  He has since become more exclusive with his tutelage, taking on
only those who devote themselves to the Wintertide.  He travels the northern

stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir.

junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

East of Tyril Square
  The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

Northeast of Tyril Square
  The northeast corner of Tyril Square is formed by the intersection of

central fountain to the southwest.  The occasional armed patrol lingers
around an arched portcullis to the east, usually coming from or going to the
north gates of the town.

Frinian Way
  Frinian Way is a broad but winding street which bends west and south as
it makes its way through New Earendam.  Scholars, artisans and other
craftsmen use this street, bringing their goods from the east part of the
city to service the mercantile activity in the Arien Plaza.  The street runs
flush with the northern wall of Earendam, which towers well over 
twelve feet in height.  Made from bricks shaped by earth scholars, the wall
is well maintained, and almost clashes with the much older and more scuffed
cobblestones of Frinian.  To the east of here, a gated archway leads toward
the headquarters of the Company of the Jackal, one of the groups of

A lean aelin form floats above the murk here, garbed in simple gray
clothing.  His wings spread out behind him carefully, shifting every now and

grooming are in sharp contrast to the surrounding swamp, as is the general
cleanliness of his figure.

A bulky, fur-covered alatharya with stringy black-silver hair crouches
here, staring towards the murky swamps carefully.  His body is wracked with
scars, though none seeming serious, and his face carries a deep, healing
gash down the left side, over his leather-patched eye.  A hired woodsman
friend of Baelin brought to Sythtys to aid their patrol, Durmaldin appears
every bit as dedicated to his watch as he is to his life.

and subdue the hunted.

The Edge of the Lowlands
  The northern grasslands slowly come into these wet-ground lowlands, which
border the swamps.  A light mist flows about the ground beneath you, and
lingers between the damp leaves of the ferns and mottled plantlife that
begin to grow 'round this area.  A marker has been set on a nearby stump; a
single band of berry-dyed leather that appears to be nailed down.  Further

  As the northern lowlands descends into the swamp, the area grows darker

light mist flows through the area, bringing a weak stench about the swamp. 
Ferns and other plantlife rise around the muddy trail, kept alive only by

maintains a careful balance between secure and welcoming.  The stone of the
monastery's central enclosure rises a few feet above the top of the
woodwork, its interior wildlife pushing at is boundaries.  From here, the
high, sloped roof rises prominently, revealing the monastery's split
eastern-western design.  The forest air is sweet, the faint breath of lilies
in its rich undertone.  A dirt path leads south back toward the forest,
while the monastery's famous sanctuary lies to the north.

An Enclosed Sanctuary
  The beginning of the monastery's miraculous sanctuary is a half-circle of
cobbled stones, giving definitive close to the road which led up to it. 
Here, the wondrous variety of the Qali clan's druidic mastery is more than
apparent; tall pines, spidery lowland trees, elms, beeches, and wide
goldenrain leaves are all visible.  The earth underfoot is dark and fertile,
partially concealed by a stretch of white rose bushes.  Stones bearing
ancient druidic markings are dug into the soil here and there, bending the
local climate to what suits the diverse array of flora.  The air is a wash
of scents, from stone, to moss, to salt, to swamp mist, to blooming flowers.
A meandering cobbled path leads through the wildlife, directing visitors
north, while smaller bare stretches lead east and west.

The Sanctuary's Heart
  At the heart of the monastery is a bounteous grove, cultivated by both
druidic ritual and centuries of meticulous tending.  The plot is roughly
circular, the earth richer and darker than one would expect for the region. 
From it grow a thick cover of ever-blooming white lilies, split only by a
meandering cobbled footpath.  In the grove's center, a spectacular living
sculpture depicts a young caladaran girl, shaped entirely from carefully
bent saplings.  The air is alive with fragrance, capturing some essential,
foreign spirit in its headiness.  The sanctuary continues in all directions,
halting only when it reaches the walls of its stone enclosure.

A Cluster of Gnarled Goldenrain Trees
  In the northwest corner of the sanctuary is an spectacular display of
oddity for the region: a series of Alenshan goldenrain trees.  Large and
gnarled from their odd captivity, their roots splay out into the earth and
many branches dig at the stone.  Yet, their many golden leaves glitter
spectacularly, rich with vitality; their bark is tough and thick.  Stones
brought from the Isle have been worked into the dark earth, each one marked
with life-giving druidic runes.  The air swells with a scent not unlike that
of sea salt, as well as the sweeter tone of water, leaf, and soil.  The
enclosed sanctuary continues to the east and south.

spiritmaster hailing from the war-torn Rirro Jagka, she made the long and
dangerous journey to Nendor first in the dreamworld, and then in the real
one.  Although she has never made expressly clear what directed her to this
place, she occasionally speaks of a blossoming rope of lilies that tethers
her to the waking world.  Her vast intelligence and curious fugue made her
initiation into the Order a foregone conclusion, bridging the realities of
mind, spirit, and body.

down from the passage of feet.  The natural spring which serves the
monastery is found here; the source of local water for monks and visitors. 
A single, bronze lantern hangs over the well, providing just enough light to

much-used path and hugging the edge of the building's exterior.  Lanterns

The Passage to the Cellar
  The small spur off of the western section of the monastery is cramped,
barely wide enough for two people to pass each other in it.  Despite leading
to the complex's earthen cellar, the well-worn floor is swept meticulously
clear of dirt or debris.  The ceiling here is a bit low, suggesting that
this hall was a late addition to the construction.  One small window, set at
about shoulder level, provides light for the hall during the day, and
ambient light serves during the rest.  The scent of earth is strong here,
venting up from the stairwell downward, and carries with it a noticeable
chill.  The spur continues to the east, and transitions into a dry storage
for the kitchen to the west.

A Well-Stocked Dry Storage
  Connected to the monastery kitchen is a storage area, meant to hold dry
or immediate supplies for its cook.  Jars of preserved fruit, strings of
hanging herbs, sacks of flour, and other necessities are all present within
its confines.  The northern wall has the largest shelves, which stand about
eight feet high; the southern counterpart is about four, allowing room for a
blurry glass window above it.  The floor is scuffed but swept clear, as this
is the most direct route from the kitchen to the monastery cellar.  While
the scent of meals lingers in the air, the bite of dry herbs and the dull
tone of flour temper it.  To the west is the kitchen proper, while the
cramped stairwell to the underground lies east.

The Monastery Kitchen
  On the southern side of the monastery's dining hall is the kitchen,
tasked with preparing food for both residents and visitors.  The walls are
unpainted wood, instead favoring a pleasant varnish; this is not echoed in
the floor, which is both unfinished and stained from cooking-related
incidents.  Prominent within is a central stone hearth and matching chimney,
and two well-fashioned counters for preparation.  A window is set into the
western wall, allowing natural light during most meal times.  The scent of
the hearth is ever-present, masked only by the flavorful aromas of meals,
made or in progress.  The dining area waits to the north, while a dry
storage lies to the east.

Ireqa is an ethron teenager of about sixteen, and she is tasked with
helping Tselak with his culinary duties.  Her skin a deep tan and her eyes a
striking ice-blue, she is obviously of Qali's blood-line, and quite handsome
in her own right.  As with most of her clan, her earliest memories are of
the sanctuary, and soon she, too, will leave to see the world beyond.  With
little desire to study the druidic arts or Lijenin psionics, she focused her
attention on cooking after meeting a foreign visitor named Tiqana.  Her
taste for the subject has grown steadily since then, with much inspiration
brought by the monastery's eccentric chef.

Tselak is a fidgety-looking nefortu with leathery brown skin and squinty,
coal-black eyes.  Once a notorious con-man in the Var Bandor underworld, he
fled the city when he became the subject of a formal investigation by the
Office of Records.  He requested amnesty at the monastery from the masters,
and graciously received it.  After months of hiding, his fear turned to
boredom; only then did he discover a special affinity for cooking.  Now
settled, he prepares meals for the locals, and finds peace away from the
ever-watching eyes of his pursuers.

  Twelve feet tall and worked from Nendorin oak, the complex's entrance
maintains a careful balance between secure and welcoming.  The stone of the
monastery's central enclosure rises a few feet above the top of the
woodwork, its interior wildlife pushing at is boundaries.  From here, the

in its rich undertone.  A dirt path leads south back toward the forest,

  The footpath comes to an end here, just before the wooden gates of the
monastery.  The buildings are tall, but below the mighty Nendorin canopy;
the proper size and sprawl of the complex is not apparent further west.  The
trees give way to long, thick grasses which encroach on the smooth cobbles
of the path and peek between some of its stones.  Wooden posts sporting
bronze enclosures are sparse, but provide enough light to make the way
visible even at night.  The air is fragrant and wild, the scents of the
forest and its creatures drifting upon it.  To the north is the entrance to
the monastery complex, while the uneven path continues west.

An Enclosed Sanctuary
  The beginning of the monastery's miraculous sanctuary is a half-circle of
cobbled stones, giving definitive close to the road which led up to it. 
Here, the wondrous variety of the Qali clan's druidic mastery is more than
apparent; tall pines, spidery lowland trees, elms, beeches, and wide
goldenrain leaves are all visible.  The earth underfoot is dark and fertile,
partially concealed by a stretch of white rose bushes.  Stones bearing
ancient druidic markings are dug into the soil here and there, bending the
local climate to what suits the diverse array of flora.  The air is a wash
of scents, from stone, to moss, to salt, to swamp mist, to blooming flowers.
A meandering cobbled path leads through the wildlife, directing visitors
north, while smaller bare stretches lead east and west.

A Rise of Mountain Pines
  In the southeast corner of the sanctuary is a rise of mountain pines,
brought from the ancient forests surrounding Castle Nathli.  Large Brintoran
rocks have been arranged between them, the occasional root reaching over it
to plunge into the earth.  The soil is lighter than elsewhere in the
sanctuary, and mixed with small, jagged rocks; pine needles mask the ground
in a blanket of light browns.  A druidic monolith stands between two of the
trees, its face scored with two ancient runes.  The air here feels thin,
making it subtly more difficult for one to catch their breath, and as dry as
in the pines' native clime.  The enclosed sanctuary continues to the north
and west.

A Shadowy Twist of Wetland
  In the northeast portion of the sanctuary is an unnatural sight: a muddy
stretch of Sythtys wetland and connected pond.  The soil is thick, brown,
and slick, quite unlike the dark earth characteristic of the monastery
grounds.  A light mist clings to the ground, ferns and other small, stubborn
plants peeking out from its wispy depths.  Twisted-bark trees spider upward,
canopying the area, and clutching as much at the enclosure's stone walls as
sinking into the mud below.  A weak swamp stench drifts on the air, which
hangs heavy over this shard of wetland; no doubt induced by the glowing
druidic markers at the mire's edges.  The enclosed sanctuary continues to
the west and south.

  In the northwest corner of the sanctuary is an spectacular display of
oddity for the region: a series of Alenshan goldenrain trees.  Large and
gnarled from their odd captivity, their roots splay out into the earth and
many branches dig at the stone.  Yet, their many golden leaves glitter
spectacularly, rich with vitality; their bark is tough and thick.  Stones
brought from the Isle have been worked into the dark earth, each one marked
with life-giving druidic runes.  The air swells with a scent not unlike that
of sea salt, as well as the sweeter tone of water, leaf, and soil.  The
enclosed sanctuary continues to the east and south.

  Behind the monastery is a dirt path leading from the Qali forum to the

hard from many generations of footsteps.  Like the rest of the untended
space behind the complex, lush grass grows wild, closing in around the
much-used path and hugging the edge of the building's exterior.  Lanterns
hang from the edge of the monastery's sloped roof, providing meager light
after dark.  The air here is clear and wild, having only a touch of the
acrid fertilizer that is used in the nearby garden.  The dirt path leads to

The Resting Quarters
  The resting quarters for the monastery are quite spartan indeed.  Most
noticeably, there are no cots; instead, a series of thin bedrolls have been
rolled out on the wooden floor, close together, and no apparent other
furniture.  The walls are beige, and comforting in the way only something
well-worn and lived-in can be.  There are no lamps, above or mounted to the
walls the room's light comes from a series of blurry windows built into the
southern wall.  While still relative fresh, the air here carries with it
some of the animal closeness one would expect of a living space.  The
resting quarters continue to the east and west.

The Eastern Vestibule
  On the east side of the sanctuary's druidic enclosure is the gateway to
this side of the monastery.  This vestibule serves as a small resting area,
with low wooden benches set against the walls for monks or petitioners.  The
structure itself is built entirely from Nendorin timber, with heavy wooden
beams supporting the ceiling and treated planks forming its walls.  On clear
days, light filters into the room through four uneven glass skylights;
otherwise, it is lit by a central hanging bronze lantern.  The sweet, heady
scents of the sanctuary drift into the room, tempered by the faint odor of
smoke and oil.  To the north is the local ward; to the south, sleeping
quarters; and to the east, an ascetic common area.

The Entrance to Lijenin Hall
  The central eastern section of the monastery is the oldest still
standing, housing its local psionicists.  While not the original
construction, it has been faithfully tended, repaired, and rebuilt by the
Lijenin Order for centuries.  Massive wooden supports in the walls and
overhead support the east side's sloped roof, and its wooden walls are
painted a mild off-white.  Bronze lanterns are mounted on each side of the
hall to light the interior with burning oil.  Because of the series of open
doorways, fresh air mingles its way into the hall, relieving it of its
closeness.  To the east, the section continues, while to the west is the
eastern vestibule.

An Enclosed Sanctuary
  A step outside the eastern vestibule is the monastery's miraculous
sanctuary.  Here, the wondrous variety of the Qali clan's druidic mastery is
more than apparent; tall pines, spidery lowland trees, elms, beeches, and
wide goldenrain leaves are all visible.  The earth underfoot is dark and
fertile, partially concealed by a smattering of rare black orchids.  Stones
bearing ancient druidic markings are dug into the soil here and there,
bending the local climate to what suits the diverse array of flora.  The air
is a wash of scents, from stone, to moss, to salt, to swamp mist, to
blooming flowers.  A meandering cobbled path leads through the wildlife,
directing visitors west, while smaller bare stretches lead north and south.

The Sanctuary's Heart
  At the heart of the monastery is a bounteous grove, cultivated by both
druidic ritual and centuries of meticulous tending.  The plot is roughly
circular, the earth richer and darker than one would expect for the region. 
From it grow a thick cover of ever-blooming white lilies, split only by a
meandering cobbled footpath.  In the grove's center, a spectacular living
sculpture depicts a young caladaran girl, shaped entirely from carefully
bent saplings.  The air is alive with fragrance, capturing some essential,
foreign spirit in its headiness.  The sanctuary continues in all directions,
halting only when it reaches the walls of its stone enclosure.

At the Wooden Gates
  Twelve feet tall and worked from Nendorin oak, the complex's entrance
maintains a careful balance between secure and welcoming.  The stone of the
monastery's central enclosure rises a few feet above the top of the
woodwork, its interior wildlife pushing at is boundaries.  From here, the
high, sloped roof rises prominently, revealing the monastery's split
eastern-western design.  The forest air is sweet, the faint breath of lilies
in its rich undertone.  A dirt path leads south back toward the forest,
while the monastery's famous sanctuary lies to the north.

Before Chanisal Monastery
  The footpath comes to an end here, just before the wooden gates of the
monastery.  The buildings are tall, but below the mighty Nendorin canopy;
the proper size and sprawl of the complex is not apparent further west.  The
trees give way to long, thick grasses which encroach on the smooth cobbles
of the path and peek between some of its stones.  Wooden posts sporting
bronze enclosures are sparse, but provide enough light to make the way
visible even at night.  The air is fragrant and wild, the scents of the
forest and its creatures drifting upon it.  To the north is the entrance to
the monastery complex, while the uneven path continues west.

A Cleared Path
  This dirt path through the forest of Nendor segues into cobblestones, and
the carefully cleared underbrush is overtaken by patches of trees and high
grass.  Tiny, stubborn weeds stick up between some of the stones, but it
does little to diminish the welcome wear of the road underfoot.  Dense
underbrush obstructs some of the view, but even from here, a large structure
is apparent to the north through the tangle.  A few wooden lamp posts
provide light for the approach, beginning roughly where the cobbles do.  The
sweet scent of the forest rides on the breeze, as pleasant as one could
hope.  The worn road continues to the south, while the light posts lead east

The Forest Path
  A thin but well worn path winds through the forest of Nendor.  Stones
inscribed with odd runic markings dot the side of the path every now and
again, standing on the border between road and forest.  Large oaks line the
path on either side, leaves casting shade upon the path below.  The singing
of birds echoes through the forest, providing a constant murmur of sound.  The
path runs south from the north, leading deeper into the forest.  To the

An Overgrown Trail
  An overgrown trail leads off from the main path to the west, and is
almost completely obscured by the undergrowth lining the main track.  This
trail meanders through a forest of leafy oak and elm, occasionally vanishing
into the trunk of a tree, or a patch of thick undergrowth, before emerging
again some way further on, heading ever eastward.  

A sheet of parchment has been nailed to a tree here.

An Overgrown Trail
  A faint trail wanders through this breezy forest of oak and elm, turning
in a wide arc from the west to the north.  The trees of the woods are
broadly spaced here, and a whistling wind plays between their trunks and
rustles in the green canopy overhead.

<541hp 284m 244mv> An Old Carriageway
  The faint trail to the south ends suddenly here, but not before it runs
into the remnants of an old carriageway.  This rutted track heads both east
and west from here, making a straight path through the deepening woods. 
From the thickness of the nettles and grass tussocks which stud the path,
and the occasional badger hole which breaches it, it would appear that the
carriageway hasn't been used in some time.

  The thick corridor of juniper to the west ends suddenly as the old
carriageway turns southward.  Here, Nendor is a dense forest of leafy oak,
its floor hidden beneath fallen branches and sprawling undergrowth.  Just to
the south, a pair of ivy-decked, bluestone gate posts flank the rutted path.

  The old carriageway continues south, passing between a pair of old,
stone gateposts.  The posts are of mortared bluestone blocks, roughly hewn,
and built into pinnacles some six feet high.  The gates themselves have long
since vanished, and all that remains of them are the heavy iron hinges,
bolted to the stone.  Thick ivy covers the gateposts, and the surrounding
shrubs almost completely obscure their presence.  To the south the path
continues through the trees, while on the northern side of the posts it
turns sharply west.

A Rutted Carriageway
  A rutted carriageway winds north and south here, between the trees of
Nendor forest.  Once cobbled with flat, white stones, the path is now badly
overgrown.  The stones are now pushed askew by grasses and saplings, or lie
buried in the mud which crowds in from the edges.  The leafy boughs of the
tall, slender trees hang over the carriage-way, forming a light tunnel.  To
the north the path passes some old gate posts, while to the south the trees
give way, revealing an ivy-covered manor house.

  Looming above you to the south is an old, stone mansion.  The building is
two stories high, with a tall bluestone tower set into the northwestern
corner. Most of this front face of the mansion is covered with thick ivy,
blending the building with the surrounding forest.  Only a few patches of
lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north
into the forest, turns east here, and disappears around the side of the
mansion. A set of heavy oak doors hang loose on their hinges to the south.

  Once splendidly appointed, this large entrance chamber is now in a state
of ruin and decay.  Wooden beams from the high, exposed roof hang
precariously from their sockets, now forming perches for the birds of the
forest, which come and go through the broken stained-glass windows. 
Girdling the southern half of the room is a wide balcony -- now unreachable,
as its wooden staircase has long since collapsed, blocking a door in the
eastern wall.  Several clocks, of different shapes and sizes, hang from the
plaster walls about the chamber, or lie toppled in the debris of the floor. 

Double doors are set in both the north and south walls, while in the western

A Dusty Sitting Room
  The curving wall of the tower cuts through this room to the northwest,
giving it an odd, almost-triangular shape.  It is efficiently furnished as a
comfortable sitting room, with a couple of divans and a single armchair
arranged about the walls, all covered in dusty white sheets.  Against the
narrow segment of the northern wall, in the nook formed between the tower
and the eastern wall, is set a beautiful, gilded harpsichord.  A tinkling
music streams from the instrument, and its keys depress and rise again, as
though at the hands of an invisible musician.  

An open doorway leads to a large chamber to the east, and a closed doorway

  This wide patio area is paved with granite flagstones, which form a
circular pattern about a large, ornate fountain.  The fountain seems to be
fed by a natural spring, because it gushes steadily with cool, clear water. 
The bowl of the fountain is cracked, and the whole structure stands
lopsided, spilling the flow southward across the patio.  Surrounding the
fountain are a few stone benches, and looming over the whole area are the
great stone arches which support the high eastern wall.  

To the north, a collapsed wall reveals a burnt-out kitchen, and to south a
pebbly path disappears into marshy ground.  The dense forest presses in to

Upon Marshy Ground
  The puddles and streams of this miniature swamp are fed from the north,
where a spring-fed fountain gushes into a trickling stream.  The waters
spread out to cover much of the ground here, creating a muddy area, studded
with deep, murky puddles.  Only a few spindley gorse bushes grow from the
sodden ground, their small, yellow flowers doing little to liven the area. 

The puddles are fed from a broken fountain to the north, which burbles
between the western forest and the looming mansion to the northeast.  To the
south a large willow grows, and a pebbly path climbs out of the marsh to
wind eastward.

Beneath the Willow Tree
  A large willow tree leans over the sodden ground, sprinkling the puddles
and rivulets with slender green leaves.  The canopy formed by the long,
sinuous branches of the willow comes almost to the ground, creating a
shielded, almost peaceful space.  Several birds hop about the marshy ground,
hunting for food in the mud.  The marsh continues to the north, while to the
west the waters gather themselves, and plunge into the forest as a burbling
stream.  To the east a pile of felled timber blocks the way, and to the

sinuous branches of the willow comes almost to the ground, creating a
shielded, almost peaceful space.  Several birds hop about the marshy ground,
hunting for food in the mud.  The marsh continues to the north, while to the
west the waters gather themselves, and plunge into the forest as a burbling
stream.  To the east a pile of felled timber blocks the way, and to the
south the thick forest presses in.

Upon Marshy Ground
  The puddles and streams of this miniature swamp are fed from the north,
where a spring-fed fountain gushes into a trickling stream.  The waters
spread out to cover much of the ground here, creating a muddy area, studded
with deep, murky puddles.  Only a few spindley gorse bushes grow from the
sodden ground, their small, yellow flowers doing little to liven the area. 

The puddles are fed from a broken fountain to the north, which burbles
between the western forest and the looming mansion to the northeast.  To the
south a large willow grows, and a pebbly path climbs out of the marsh to
wind eastward.

Beneath the Southern Mansion Wall
  A path of white pebbles, muddy and overgrown, passes beneath the
southern-most wall of the mansion here.  The high stone wall is supported by
two elegant flying buttresses, which arch over the garden below.  Woodbine
and ivy, mottled red and green, cling thickly to the stonework, forming
great veils with sway in the wind beneath the arches.  The pebble path
continues east and west, while to the south an area of the garden has been
cleared.

A Clearing in the Garden
  A part of the garden has been cleared and flattened here, forming a wide
circle of bare ground.  Ivy and blackberries have been hacked and burned,
and several beautiful trees have recently been felled.  They now lie in a
pile which blocks the way west.  However a few slender birch trees still
stand to the south, and from these some crude canvas shelters have been
strung.  In the center of the clearing a large fire burns warmly.

  A magnificent oak tree spreads its limbs over this part of the garden,
shading the acorn-scattered ground with its thick foliage.  The creepers and
vines, so thick to the north, still cover some of the ground here, and climb
up the lower parts of the oak's trunk.  However a new invader is beginning
to drive back the ivy - thick growths of blackberry rise in an impenetrable
wall to the south, and sprawl over a dilapidated carriage house to the east,
their strangling tendrils stretching out toward the oak.  To the west the
ground seems to have been cleared somewhat.

The Caretaker's Cottage
  The dingy interior of this caretaker's cottage has been patched up as
well as possible, so that it is now only just fit for habitation.  Broken
windows have been boarded over, and holes in the walls and roof covered
crudely.  This main room of the cottage holds most of the essentials - a
rickety cot against the north wall, and a small fireplace in the south.  A
table stands in the center of the room, upon which rests a half-eaten meal. 

Doors lead out of this room to the east and west.

A Junk-Filled Storeroom
  The rear room of this caretaker's cottage has been converted to a storage
room for junk.  A few benches line the walls, and on these lie dozens of
gardening and carpentry tools, missing heads, handles, or simply rusting to
pieces.  Under the benches are stacked a large array of pots, buckets, and
barrels.  In one corner, surrounding an old cupboard, lies a pile of strange
mechanical devices - metallic frames crammed with cogs, levers and gears.

iron ribs, with cogs, gears and flywheels completely still.  A section of
the clockwork appears to have been tampered with.  The mechanoid has eyes of

A Clearing Before a Small Cottage
  A grassy clearing opens between the privet to the north and west, and the
dense forest to the south, forming a small front lawn for the little cottage
to the east.  The cottage looks quite dilapidated, with boards missing from
the walls, and large sections of terracotta tiles missing from the roof.  A
narrow porch, bordered by a carved wooden railing, extends from the front of
the cottage, in the center of which is set a faded door.  A tunnel through
the privet extends to the west.

A Tunnel Beneath the Privet Bushes
  The intertwining branches of the privet bushes form a thick wall about
this tunnel, studded with dark leaves and small, delicate-looking white
flowers.  The passage seems to have been hacked away by hand, and the ground
is covered with branches and hewn stumps.  The narrow way continues to the
north, and opens up to the east into a grassy clearing.

in place by a row of birch trees to the north, and a thick growth of
white-flowered privet to the south.  The privet also grows to the west,
although more thinly, and a wall of blackberries blocks the eastern exit. 
The floor of the shelter is littered with blankets, filthy clothing, and
shabby personal belongings of little worth - clearly the refuge of an
unsavoury gang.

A Clearing in the Garden
  A part of the garden has been cleared and flattened here, forming a wide
circle of bare ground.  Ivy and blackberries have been hacked and burned,
and several beautiful trees have recently been felled.  They now lie in a
pile which blocks the way west.  However a few slender birch trees still
stand to the south, and from these some crude canvas shelters have been
strung.  In the center of the clearing a large fire burns warmly.

two elegant flying buttresses, which arch over the garden below.  Woodbine

great veils with sway in the wind beneath the arches.  The pebble path
continues east and west, while to the south an area of the garden has been

  The puddles and streams of this miniature swamp are fed from the north,
where a spring-fed fountain gushes into a trickling stream.  The waters
spread out to cover much of the ground here, creating a muddy area, studded
with deep, murky puddles.  Only a few spindley gorse bushes grow from the
sodden ground, their small, yellow flowers doing little to liven the area. 

The puddles are fed from a broken fountain to the north, which burbles
between the western forest and the looming mansion to the northeast.  To the
south a large willow grows, and a pebbly path climbs out of the marsh to
wind eastward.

  This wide patio area is paved with granite flagstones, which form a
circular pattern about a large, ornate fountain.  The fountain seems to be
fed by a natural spring, because it gushes steadily with cool, clear water. 
The bowl of the fountain is cracked, and the whole structure stands
lopsided, spilling the flow southward across the patio.  Surrounding the
fountain are a few stone benches, and looming over the whole area are the
great stone arches which support the high eastern wall.  

To the north, a collapsed wall reveals a burnt-out kitchen, and to south a
pebbly path disappears into marshy ground.  The dense forest presses in to
the west.

A Burnt-Out Kitchen
  The burnt and gutted remains of this kitchen lies exposed to elements,
with the southern wall completely collapsed.  A single chimney is all that
remains of that wall, and in the hearth at the base of the chimney, a small
fire flickers.  A blackened pot bubbles and hisses upon an iron hook over
the flame.  The ceiling is still intact, although badly scorched, and a
large slab of it lies on the floor in the center of the room.

A Mouldering Dining Room
  A long dining room extends to the north and south, and is sparsely
furnished, with only an ornately-carved dining table and its dozen chairs
occupying the center of the room.  Dampness seems to have mouldered both the
plaster of the walls and the wood of the dining set, and a moist, organic
stench fills the air.  Mixed with this is the distinct musky smell of an
animal, as though something had made this room its den.  

Decaying wooden doors are set in both the north and south walls.

A Dusty Sitting Room
  The curving wall of the tower cuts through this room to the northwest,
giving it an odd, almost-triangular shape.  It is efficiently furnished as a
comfortable sitting room, with a couple of divans and a single armchair
arranged about the walls, all covered in dusty white sheets.  Against the
narrow segment of the northern wall, in the nook formed between the tower
and the eastern wall, is set a beautiful, gilded harpsichord.  A tinkling
music streams from the instrument, and its keys depress and rise again, as
though at the hands of an invisible musician.  

An open doorway leads to a large chamber to the east, and a closed doorway
to the south.

The Entrance Hall
  Once splendidly appointed, this large entrance chamber is now in a state
of ruin and decay.  Wooden beams from the high, exposed roof hang
precariously from their sockets, now forming perches for the birds of the
forest, which come and go through the broken stained-glass windows. 
Girdling the southern half of the room is a wide balcony -- now unreachable,
as its wooden staircase has long since collapsed, blocking a door in the
eastern wall.  Several clocks, of different shapes and sizes, hang from the
plaster walls about the chamber, or lie toppled in the debris of the floor. 

Double doors are set in both the north and south walls, while in the western
wall the door has fallen from its hinges, and a faint, tinkling music comes
from the room beyond.

By the Doors of an Old Mansion
  Looming above you to the south is an old, stone mansion.  The building is
two stories high, with a tall bluestone tower set into the northwestern
corner. Most of this front face of the mansion is covered with thick ivy,
blending the building with the surrounding forest.  Only a few patches of
lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north
into the forest, turns east here, and disappears around the side of the
mansion. A set of heavy oak doors hang loose on their hinges to the south.

A Rutted Carriageway
  A rutted carriageway winds north and south here, between the trees of
Nendor forest.  Once cobbled with flat, white stones, the path is now badly
overgrown.  The stones are now pushed askew by grasses and saplings, or lie
buried in the mud which crowds in from the edges.  The leafy boughs of the
tall, slender trees hang over the carriage-way, forming a light tunnel.  To
the north the path passes some old gate posts, while to the south the trees
give way, revealing an ivy-covered manor house.

By the Ivy-Covered Gate Posts
  The old carriageway continues south, passing between a pair of old,
stone gateposts.  The posts are of mortared bluestone blocks, roughly hewn,
and built into pinnacles some six feet high.  The gates themselves have long
since vanished, and all that remains of them are the heavy iron hinges,
bolted to the stone.  Thick ivy covers the gateposts, and the surrounding
shrubs almost completely obscure their presence.  To the south the path
continues through the trees, while on the northern side of the posts it
turns sharply west.

innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables

through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  A carved shield
marks the door of an armory to the north, while a hanging sign emblazoned
with a sword calls attention to the weapon shop to the south.  Raddin street
continues to the east, while the main drag of Sadrent road opens to the
west.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

  These scattered wooden tables are filled by warriors, come to the tavern

standing guard.  The rest of the tavern lies off to the west and south.

  The room reeks of alcohol and other smells that aren't so easily
recognizable.  A small, ragged rug lies on the wooden floor, creaky, but by
no means run down.  A plain check-in desk sits in the middle of the room,
and a small brownish stool just behind that.  A few other chairs that don't
look stable enough to support much weight lie scattered about but that's it
in the way for furniture.

its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a

smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes

  This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling

hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against

sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  A carved shield
marks the door of an armory to the north, while a hanging sign emblazoned
with a sword calls attention to the weapon shop to the south.  Raddin street
continues to the east, while the main drag of Sadrent road opens to the
west.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the south is the central square of
Var Bandor.  

[Exits: north south]
A journeyman templar of the Var Bandor faction walks along the street.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.
