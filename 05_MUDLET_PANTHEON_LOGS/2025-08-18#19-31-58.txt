Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

Arcanos Street
  Arcanos Street is a wide avenue paved with gray stones.  The buildings in
this section of town show an odd architecture, as if they are designed for
purposes other than the usual.  Visible are pyramidic rooftops, domed
towers, and arched entryways.  Controlled by the scholar faction of Var
Bandor, this area is well cared for, with hired servants sweeping the
cobblestones and running errands to and fro.  To the north is an oddly
shaped residence.  West is Ilrin Street.

An Oddly-formed Residence
  The inside of this house is a sight to behold.  The room itself is much
larger than it appears from the outside, disorienting you slightly. 
Flickering flames provide a warm light, although most of the flames just
seem to be floating in mid-air by the walls, not attached to any sort of
source.  Many portraits line the walls, and magical feather dusters fly
about the room, making sure no dust mars the beautiful appearance of the
room, and its many magical toys.  A plush red couch sits against one wall,
and a small table sits in front of it.  On the table, an illusion of a
dancer moves inside a small glass globe.  Inset into the north wall, a
doorway leads into what appears to be a laboratory, and Arcanos lies out the
door to the south.

A Wizard's Laboratory
  This laboratory is bustling with activity, with enchanted tools flying
about performing various research-related tasks.  A long table stands in the
middle of the room, covered with all manner of jars, vials, containers, and
more.  A large shelf full of books is on the north wall.  The laboratory is
filled with all sorts of unsettling smells, and faint burbling and popping
noises.
