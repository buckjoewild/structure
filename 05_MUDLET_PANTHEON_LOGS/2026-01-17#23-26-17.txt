Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the east is Center Square.

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

A large male chaja is here, as most chaja his form is robust and massive.
Unruly and almost dusty fur covers his body, the color an earthen-brown
shade.  His face bears no remarkable features except for his eyes having a
frosty-blue hue.  Several old large scars can be seen across his whole body,
two noticable ones around his wrists looks somewhat new.  
Tjalk has some small wounds and bruises.

The Blacksmith
  It's thrice hotter inside the blacksmith's than it is on the street.  A
thick curtain of smoke hangs in the air, and metal shavings cover the floor.
Three large, hot furnaces are built into the far wall, creating the immense
heat of this room.  An anvil and hammer sit off near the far corner, along
with a barrel full of cool water.  A large pile of scrap metal sits off in
one corner, waiting to be molded into something.  North leads from the near
unbearable temperature back unto the street.

  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people

  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

In the Tables
  The tables are scattered around the room in what seems to be a random
fashion, but there is still ample space for the barmaids to walk through to
set out food and drinks.  A large fireplace dominates the south wall, the
hearth is swept and ready for a warm fire during the winter.  A small
staircase leads upwards in the south-west corner of the room, to the
comfortable beds waiting for a weary customer to rest upon.  East are the
swinging doors leading to the kitchen, and north lies the entrance to the
inn.

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is

and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit

seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of

The Eastern Docks of Var Bandor
  The solid stone walls of Var Bandor rise to the west, casting a shadow on
the docks.  Before you to the east spreads a bustling scene of activity as
merchants oversee dockhands unloading their barges, loading new cargos, and
transporting merchandise.  Beyond the docks flow the murky waters of the
Dantaron river, teeming with rafts and barges.

for its reknowned mead.  Most of the people seated here seem to be grizzled
campaigners - mainly footman and the occasional pikeman from Var Bandor's
standing guard.  The rest of the tavern lies off to the west and south.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

A Flophouse
  The room reeks of alcohol and other smells that aren't so easily
recognizable.  A small, ragged rug lies on the wooden floor, creaky, but by
no means run down.  A plain check-in desk sits in the middle of the room,
and a small brownish stool just behind that.  A few other chairs that don't
look stable enough to support much weight lie scattered about but that's it
in the way for furniture.

A Dingy Office
  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

Discount Guides of Var Bandor
  A small room fronts this establishment, a curtained-off door concealing
anything further in.  A creaky old desk fills entirely too much of the room,
covered in papers and carefully-stacked scrolls.  The walls are covered in
old handbills announcing bounties long since collected, gladiatorial bouts
from at least a year ago, and a few advertisments for local shops.  The
floor is kept cleaner than anything else in the place, and it too bears the
signs of too many feet walking over it.

The Saurian Armory
  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop's north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air

is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop's unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

eventually leading to Earendam eastward.  The stone walls of Var Bandor
tower menacingly to the south, and north and south of the river ferry
stations have been set up.

  The winding Dantaron River turns to the east, flowing by the city of Var
Bandor. The placid, muddy waters ripple gently as they run their course,
eventually leading to Earendam eastward.  The stone walls of Var Bandor
tower menacingly to the south, and a short distance ahead another river's

At a Fork in the Dantaron River
  The Dantaron River flows west to east, passing the city of Var Bandor to
the southwest.  The muddy waters of the Aragol River flow in from the south,
joining with the Dantaron at this point.  Farther south along the Aragol are
the docks of Var Bandor, and to the west is a ferry station.

A Small Dirt Path
  This dirt path leads out of the hilly freehold to the flat river plain
near Var Bandor.  It appears well-trodden by people and animals of all
descriptions, particularly geese.  Wagon ruts give some sign of the commerce
between the farms and the city, bringing crops and honey to the river
traffic running between Var Bandor and Earendam.  Though the woods encroach
upon the path to the east and west, it is easily passable to the north and
south.

At the Bottom of a Low Hill
  The ground begins sloping upwards to the west here, with more rocks
visible pushing to the surface.  The chalky pebbles seem to choke off the
plant life to some extent, but a fair amount of grass and shrubbery still
appears able to thrive.  Westwards, the slope continues upwards to a chalk
ridge, while a stand of mature aspen trees grows in the more fertile soil to
the south.  An outdoor shrine lies to the east, and a dirt path follows a
barely-perceptible downwards slope to the north.

A Small Shrine on a Hill
  A circle of standing stones rings the top of this small hill, the chalky
rock cut into even blocks about seven feet tall.  The terrain is gentle,
rolling hills slowly descending into the muddy shallows of Jasa Lake far to
the south, and to the Dantaron River to the north.  A small copse of trees
is visible to the southwest.  Within the circle, a small altar sits at the
feet of a simple statue.  A gurgling fountain pours into a pool about the
statue, and several small fruit trees have been planted next to some of the
standing stones.  A feeling of peace and safety permeates the area. 
Pathways lead out of the circle in all directions.

The End of a Shallow Valley
  Rising gently from the north, the valley ends here with only a vague
depression compared to the surrounding terrain.  The ground is host to a
sparse covering of grass, struggling to survive in the poor soil.  Flakes of
chalk litter the ground, fragile enough to break under even a light
footstep.  To the west, standing stones form a ring around a statue.  The
terrain continues its rise to the south, culminating in a low hill.

A Low, Grassy Hill
  This low, grassy hill is part of a long rise which ripples the terrain of
the Lithling Freehold.  Tough green grass grows in patchy swaths along the
hillside, stretches of chalky white stone showing through in many places.  A
white boulder of the same stone crowns the top of the hill here.  The rise
continues levelly to the north.  To the east and west the land dips sharply.
A stand of hemlocks cluster in the dell to the east.  To the northwest a
tall hill stands, crowned with a circle of white stones.

A Flowery Meadow
  This small field occupies a depression in the surrounding hills. 
Shielded from the sometimes-harsh winds through the hills, it has proven a
fertile environment for all manner of delicate flowers.  The rolling terrain
prevents you from looking very far in any direction, but treetops are
visible all around.  The meadow opens through a shallow gap between a pair
of hills to the east.

degree that very little remains, with exposed rocks and gravel covering the
ground.  It is possible to pick your way over the rocks to the south.

A Grassy Hill
  This hill is covered with long, tenacious prairie grass, bending low with

grass, hunting for seeds.  The ground here is surprisingly firm, perhaps
owing to the density of grass roots just beneath the surface.  To the north

A Muddy Depression
  Jasa Lake is only a short distance to the south, and appears to be

decaying plants to generate a thoroughly unpleasant smell and swarms of
annoying flies.  The ground rises to firmer, drier heights to the north and
west, while the truly waterlogged beach of Jasa Lake is south.

  A small beach is here, its thick brown sand almost entirely saturated

itself is low-lying, only barely venturing above the level of water within

Behind a Small Shack
  Marsh grasses and weeds cover the ground in this locale, rustling softly
at any disturbance.  Each blade of grass is crowned with a tassled head, and
stands about five inches shorter than most of the lavender-capped weeds.  A
few brambles make their presence known, most of which cling to the back of
the hut to the west.  The back wall of the shack is mildewed and dirty but
is otherwise entirely featureless.  A path leads through the plants toward
town to the north, while the flora grows more wildly to the east.

A Marshy Plot, Overrun by Reeds
  This area of the marsh is entirely covered by assorted grass, weeds, and
plantlife.  A few random stones are buried in the mud here, creating small
pockets of space where the plants do not intrude.  A small, ramshackle house
with a wild rosebush clinging to its mouldering surface stands to the east. 
The mass of plantlife here thins slightly to the north, giving way to a

  The patch of ground here is very muddy and is marked with many deep
reptilian footprints from creatures of varying sizes.  Reeds sprout from the
mud in abundance, towering nearly seven feet high in places.  Mount Enrien is
visible over the tops of the plants to the south far in the distance, while
more immediately south the plants simply continue.  The flora thins

The only one of the warrior professions with a true military background,
fighters as an organized profession date back to the foundations of the human
Republic of Earendam. It was here where the phalanxes which are now iconic of
the class came into being, proving invaluable time and time again as the city
grew and required defending. The aelin have since found much to admire in such
organized battles, and those with less interest in more graceful arts have
brought the profession to their cities. In their constant battles with
Earendam, even the brutal srryn have learned the discipline's rudiments from
their enemies.

Though learned in several weapons, fighters as a class focus primarily on
using either a spear and shield, which provides unparalleled defensive
capability, a polearm, which allows them to make devastating strikes against
entire groups of opponents, or a sword and shield, with which they may
debilitate a single foe at a time. Even outside of a military setting, they
are highly trained in managing their own groups, protecting their companions
and moving them swiftly about the battlefield.

Fighters may be of any alignment, but due to the inherently organized nature
of the profession, they may not be chaotic. Iandir is a popular choice of god
amongst fighters, for his own adherence to order. More combative fighters
often favour Dolgrael, and those who are chaja or srryn often follow the gods
of the shuddeni or their own people's, respectively. However, the profession
has no inherently religious calling, and many fighters name no individual god
as their personal patron.

The oldest of Avendar's warrior creeds, the barbarian has been a fixture of 
the wild since the earliest ages of man. The first of the fallen alatharya 
shamans were eager to call upon their strength and fury in times of need; the 
the feral kankoran, the brutal srryn, and young humanity would all seek power 
through similar means. The terrifying vision of the horde which broke the 
Republic is never far from cityfolk who encounter the modern barbarian, 
ensuring that their guilds are never exulted in civilized city-states. 
  
The barbarian's methods are as crude and harsh as the ancient world which 
shaped him; the axe, the mace, and the wilderness are his steadfast 
companions. He is most well-known for his mighty hews, which have broken the 
bodies of adventurer and creature alike. His skill with the mace allow him to 
shatter bone or daze his foes, striking fear into the hearts of spellcasters 
who might oppose him. He can create simple, ad-hoc weapons and necessities in 
forests. Finally, he can feast upon the flesh of the defeated, and craft 
clothing from their hides. 
  
Barbarians may be of any alignment, but due to their wild, roaming natures, 
they may never be lawful. Kankoran deities are the primary patrons of those 
who wish to destroy the cities of men, and thus many barbarians find value in 
their creeds. Enirra and Dolgrael are often popular amongst humans and 
alatharya, while srryn are near-universally heed the call of Sythrak. However, 
barbarians are as diverse and free-natured as the great beasts who roam 
Avendar's vast wilderness, leading many to serve only their own personal 
whims.

The creed of the highwayman is among Avendar's oldest.  These brutish
robbers often scorn elegance or grace, instead favoring swift brutality and
merciless plunder.  Although the precise origin of the craft is unknowable,
it was certainly humans who made it especially famous.  As their race
expanded, so too were resources scarce enough to require violent
reallocation.  The speed of the srryn has left its mark on banditry in
general, their swift claws refining the art of robbery to a razor edge.  So,
too, have the fallen alatharya benefitted greatly from and elaborated upon
its methods, making famous its characteristic brawling moves.  

Bandits are especially proficient in unarmed combat, excelling at both
striking harder and blocking more easily than others.  Despite their skill,
the bandit disregards the trained acrobatics of the assassin and the quick
dagger of the thief.  They are well known for their combinations of attacks
skill with maces.  Of course, the bandit's deadliest tricks happen when
others have been beaten into unconsciousness, be it ambushing, ropes, or
gags.  Even with only rags to his name, a bandit is rarely at a loss while
fighting.  

Law is a concept that has little meaning to a creed founded upon sudden
robbery.  In conjunction with their brutish tempers, bandits rarely have a
place in civilized society except at its fringes.  Bandits have no one deity
they call their own and are given to wandering more than settling.  This
freedom affords them the luxury of taking as they please, from whoever
strikes their fleeting fancy.

A Rugged Marsh
  The ground here is covered with brush and thick bushes.  A few thin trees
stand tall near the south, casting patches of shade on the ground.  Tangled
bushes and thorny thickets grow close to the muddy ground, serving to make
passage on foot rather difficult.  A wall of thorns and tangled vines over
which the top of Mt.  Enrien is visible grows to the south, blocking
passage.  The tree covered marsh continues to the east.  The ground to the

than unruly woods.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.
