Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty.

  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.

The weaponsmith polishes his arsenal, keeping it in good condition.

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

members.  Chaja will frequently address unrelated elders as 'auntie' or 'uncle' as a sign of 
respect.

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.

While some may feature ornamentation or spikes, maces are at their heart a
very simple weapon: a short length of metal or wood, typically used as a means
of blunt force. For this reason, they are often favoured by scholars and
templars of the earth, as well as barbarians, though several guilds train in
the usage of this weapon. Due to the length and balance of these weapons,
maces do not parry blows very well, and if offhanded will hurt one's main-hand
parrying. Maces will get around both shields and watchers' deflection
relatively easily.

One of the most commonly-produced and commonly-trained weapons in Avendar,
swords are simple to learn the basics of, but may take decades to master. The
only weapon with an entire profession dedicated solely to their usage, in the
hands of most others, swords are a particularly average weapon. Typically
slashing or piercing, they range from slender rapiers to massive two-handed
claymores.

Bladed weapons with a typically short haft, axes are most often favoured by
barbarians, who enjoy their lack of subtlety and learn specific techniques for
them. Axes may be found in many sizes, for both one and two-handed use. They
typically deal slashing damage, and they are characteristically poor at
fending off blows, due to their balance and lack of finesse. The weighty
swings often required by axes make it suited against both shield blocking and
deflection, but much easier for opponents to fend off or stone phalanx.

A flail is a weight attached by a chain or hinge to a handle, designed to
penetrate armor through blunt or piercing force, though they are often used
interchangably with the less flexible maces. Only gladiators recieve extensive
training in the usage of flails, but other professions are taught the basics.
Because of their flexibility and the somewhat awkward movements to wield them,
they are not terribly suited to defend with, and will make it more difficult
to parry when they are offhanded. Flails are particularly effective against
foes who are dodging, deflecting, or shield blocking.

An Empty Alleyway
  This is more a very small alcove than much of an alleyway, a tiny space
crammed between an old warehouse and a shipping office.  Some piles of junk
lie shoved against the wall, a handy storage space for things people haven't
gotten around to throwing away yet, and trash and an empty mug or two lie
scattered about.  It is very dark, barely any light coming in from the road
or sky, and unseen eyes watch from the shadows at the rear of this niche.

  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

The Adventurer's Lounge
  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower
of Testing.  This space, however, is known as the Adventurer's Lounge, which
is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is a place for friends
to gather before entering the Tower of Testing, which trains young
adventurers in the ways of battle.  The dim echoes of its sounds filter back
into the lounge now and then, as a solemn reminder of how all students
eventually make their fortunes.  To the west and south, the lounge
continues.  Far to the west is the Hall of Trials and its training
exercises.

and couches much like the rest, with a large, well-worn area rug in the
middle.  Notably, a well-polished bar stands against the south wall, and an
additional hallway leads to the east.  The lounge continues to the north and
west, its high, pale stones and well-lit accommodations inviting students to
linger.  Far to the north is the entrance to the Tower of Testing.

The Entrance to the Hall of Victors
  This spur off of the Adventurer's Lounge leads to a tremendous archway. 
It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's
interior lies east, while the lounge is to the west.  

A small note is tacked to the archway.

  The Hall of Victors houses the emissary of the family of the School of
Heroes' illustrious founder, and it is his task to reward those valiant
young adventurers who complete the Tower of Testing.  The rough-hewn stone
of the arched entryway gives way to a set of two large steps, and then a
large, circular platform made of polished tiles.  The walls transition
almost immediately into the School's characteristic marble.  The entrance to
the Hall of Victors lies to the west, while an opulent chamber lies to the
south in its interior.

and woman.

An Exotic Parlor in the Hall of Victors
  A great octagonal room, this sumptuous parlor opens up to a fantastically
high ceiling.  Many thick, blood-red drapes shroud the marblework of its
walls, giving it a great tent-like atmosphere.  Just above the sturdy bronze
rodding that holds the drapery aloft, the ceiling slopes upward into a
sharp, open-topped steeple.  A number of polished, dull orbs of light line
the interior of the steeple's high point, the bronze chains that dangle
beneath them glittering like tiny stars.  Against the south wall, a massive
and ornate divan dominates the room, its elaborate designs only heightening
the general exoticism.  Much of the floor is covered by a circular farsh
rug, covering the polished Harrudim tile beneath it.  The scents of spice
hang in the dim, smoky air, giving the parlor an even more opulent flair.

An imposing, dark-skinned man with piercing eyes, Zebenar Kinest is the
most recent owner of the School of Heroes.  His coal-black hair is
well-groomed, matching both his opulent surroundings and the fine cut of his
clothing.  Once a famed scourge of young adventurers throughout Avendar, he
eventually realized there were safer ways to indulge in his amusements. 
Using the fortunes he had amassed through his famous exploits, he purchased
the School of Heroes for its disconcerting record of imp-related training
accidents.  He now rewards those who survive the Tower of Testing with a
small token of his esteem.  
Zebenar Kinest is in excellent condition.

The Hall of Victors
  The Hall of Victors houses the emissary of the family of the School of
Heroes' illustrious founder, and it is his task to reward those valiant
young adventurers who complete the Tower of Testing.  The rough-hewn stone
of the arched entryway gives way to a set of two large steps, and then a
large, circular platform made of polished tiles.  The walls transition
almost immediately into the School's characteristic marble.  The entrance to
the Hall of Victors lies to the west, while an opulent chamber lies to the
south in its interior.  

A huge statue stands at the center of the platform, depicting a stylized man
and woman.

The Entrance to the Hall of Victors
  This spur off of the Adventurer's Lounge leads to a tremendous archway. 
It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School's many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall's
interior lies east, while the lounge is to the west.  

A small note is tacked to the archway.

The Bar in the Adventurer's Lounge
  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower
of Testing.  This space, however, is known as the Adventurer's Lounge, which
is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is arranged with chairs
and couches much like the rest, with a large, well-worn area rug in the
middle.  Notably, a well-polished bar stands against the south wall, and an
additional hallway leads to the east.  The lounge continues to the north and
west, its high, pale stones and well-lit accommodations inviting students to
linger.  Far to the north is the entrance to the Tower of Testing.  

A small sign sits on the end of the bar.

to gather before entering the Tower of Testing, which trains young
adventurers in the ways of battle.  The dim echoes of its sounds filter back
into the lounge now and then, as a solemn reminder of how all students
eventually make their fortunes.  To the west and south, the lounge
continues.  Far to the west is the Hall of Trials and its training
exercises.

A Rough-Hewn Stairwell
  To the west of the Adventurer's Lounge is a western alcove.  A set of
well-trodden stairs descend to a lower level and the beginning of the Hall of
Trials.  The alcove and the stairs it contains, much like other parts of the
School's lower facilities, are made of old, rough-hewn stone.  A hanging
banner informs students of where the stairs lead, and provides a splash of
color to an otherwise dark and grey passage.  Footsteps echo here, and the
cool air carries with it the musty scent of an ancient basement.  To the
east lies the inviting warmth of the lounge, while below await the School's

The Entrance to the Hall of Trials
  The entrance to the Hall of Trials is a gloomy affair, made from heavy
blocks of rough-hewn stone.  An old, echoing stairwell leads down to this
somber room, its wide steps worn with the passing of many ages.  Much like
the Tower of Testing, the Hall of Trials is lit with lonely oil lanterns,
casting the old stone with many shadows.  The air is cool and musty,
bringing with it the scents of old water and rich earth.  Through an archway
to the north lies the Hall proper, which contains many exercises to test new
students to the School of Heroes.  The stairwell leads upward into a small
alcove which leads back into the Adventurer's Lounge.

The Hall of Trials
  The Hall of Trials is intended to help students of the School of Heroes
to learn how to overcome basic obstacles and use universal techniques.  This
includes physical barriers, environmental conditions, and abilities
available to all adventurers.  The Hall is incredibly old, built of
rough-hewn blocks that have the musty scent of age.  The floor has been worn
smooth by generations of young adventurers walking upon it, but is generally
swept clean of debris.  At regular intervals along the ceiling are oil
lanterns, which cast shadows throughout.  To the west, a doorway leads to an
adjoining hallway.  

A plaque near the door reads, "The Test of Keys".

The Test of the Statue
  The room which houses the Test of the Statue is almost perfectly cubical,
walled with a series of rough-hewn blocks.  Unlike much of the Hall of
Trials, this room seems less ancient and more heavily trafficked.  Fully ten
feet on a side, the only notable feature of the room is a freestanding
pedestal at the room's center.  Atop the pedestal is a stone statue, carved
in the likeness of a stone gargoyle.  A lantern hanging from the ceiling
casts the room with fickle light.  The Hall of Trials lies to the west.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
east is Sadrent Road.

A Run-Down Weaponry
  This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling
is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop's unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the

in the surrounding parts of the city, the shop lacks the forge common in
most such places.  The north part of the room is taken up with a counter,
beside which a full set of field plate is arranged on a pole.  A pine door
leads through a wall to the west, and the way onto the street lies south.

Vandar's Blades
  Vandar's Blades is a well-furnished shop, offering the wares created by
the craftsman who inhabit the artisan's district of Earendam.  With no forge
in evidence, the shop is remarkably comfortable, offering a wide variety of
weapons on display on the walls behind the counter that takes up the north
half of the room.  The wall to the east is rather thin, and is broken by a
pine door.  A doorway also leads southward onto Frinian Way, which runs in
past the front of the shop.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Lining the street are shops bearing the products of the
craftsmen who work in this part of the city.  To the south is a jeweller's
shop, which is successful enough to have a plate glass window to display its
wares.  The weapon maker's shop to the north has no such trappings, but
nevertheless bears the symbols of its wares on a stout wooden sign.  Frinian
continues much the same to both the east and west.

  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's

to connect the Glallian School to the east with Tyril Square which lies
further west down the street.  A small side street leads north, and a stone
wall prevents further travel southward.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way begins here, serving as a throughway for the scholars
and craftsman who travel to and from Tyril Square to the west and the
artisan's district of Earendam further east.  To the south of the street,
marble stairs lead up to enter some sort of scholar's shop, while the
building to the north is less ostentatious, being a simple stone block
guarded by gate archways.  Home to the Company of the Ram, the building
houses one of Earendam's chartered mercenary companies.

East of Tyril Square
  The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

Center of Tyril Square
  The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

  A narrow strip of stones that leads north into the grasslands, the

mountain outposts to the north.  It has since fallen into disuse, but is

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.
