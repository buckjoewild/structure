Commerce Street
  Surrounded by newly constructed buildings, Commerce Street winds through
the merchant quarter of Var Bandor.  All around are signs of great wealth,
the gold that flows from the prosperous trade evident in the buildings, the
clothing of the citizens, and the meticulous maintenance of the streets. 
Commerce Street turns south and east at this point, and to the west is a
magnificent structure, the headquarters of the Var Bandor Merchant Council.

  The most noticeable feature in the Bank is the line of teller windows
along the far wall.  The keen eyes of bankers peer out from behind the
barred windows, scrutinizing their clientele.  Plants and small wooden
benches provide the decor for those waiting for service, and a doorway leads
southwards onto Commerce Street.

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the south is the central square of
Var Bandor.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

Outside the Northern Gatehouse
  The towering gates of Var Bandor rise to the south.  Huge, heavy wooden
doors reinforced with iron bars, the gates are maintained rigorously.  The
walls to the east and west are solid stone, with murder slits.  To the
north, the river Dantaron splits into two mighty forks which flow by Var
Bandor on either side.
