| * Real life names are allowed, but references to real people are not.    |
| * All character names must be unique and may not reference other         |
|   settings or works of fiction outside Avendar.                          |
| * For more detailed information and examples, see HELP NAME.             |

| Avendar, like most MUDs, uses colored text to help highlight what is     |
| happening during play.  This includes communication channels, damage     |

|                        The Lineages of Avendar                           |
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Human:     Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.      |
| Aelin:     Slight with feathered wings, known for their grace and pride. |
| Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.  |
| Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions. |
| Chaja:     Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns. |
| Ch'taren:  Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.       |
| Ethron:    Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.    |
| Nefortu:   Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.      |
| Shuddeni:  Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.       |
| Srryn:     Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.   |
|                                                                          |
| All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do   |
| not exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical      |
| maturity for their lineage, which may vary between species.              |
|                                                                          |
| Each lineage will have different innate traits (such as flight or        |
| darkvision) and a different spread of maximum statistics. For more       |
| information, including a table of max stats, see HELP STATISTICS.        |
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Select your lineage (help for more information)? 
chaja
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
|                                  Chaja                                   |
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Most chaja communities live in isolated strongholds in the Brintor       |
| mountains, ordering their lives by the stars.  Owing to this isolation,  |
| chaja are most widely known across Avendar for their use by the shuddeni |
| as slaves, particularly during the War of Night.  Chaja are caprine      |
| giants with wooly hair covering most of their bodies, uniformly pale     |
| eyes, and small, nubby horns.  They are nearly as tall as the alatharya, |
| but have rounder, softer bodies with little muscle definition.  Their    |
| size allows them to wield two-handed weapons in a single hand.  They     |
| can see in darkness, and may safely eat nearly anything.  For more       |
| information, read HELP CHAJA.                                            |

/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Traits represent unusual abilities, training, or expertise in a niche    |

[  0] Iandir: Welcome to Avendar
Tue Oct 29 22:51:07 2024
To: all immortal
Welcome to Avendar.  Whether this is your first character or the latest
of many, we appreciate you joining us.  If you have not played in some time,
be aware that there have been significant changes to classes, lineages,
skills, spells, items, encounters, and the world in general.  Many things
may be very different from how you remember them being.  

A summary of some of our recent updates:

- Most restrictions on possible lineage and class combinations have been
removed.  

- Stats, HP, and MP may no longer be trained.  HP/MP is now based on class
alone.  Stats will automatically advance as you level.  Please see HELP
STATS for more information.  

- Skill practicing is now decoupled from stats.  Most skills will now always
practice to 75%.  

- All stats have been rebalanced and what each stat does has changed. 
Please see HELP STATS for more information.  

- All bonuses and penalties to experience gain based on resonance/aura have
been removed.  This will still affect your own aura.  

- Girikha is dead, slain by adventurers by command of Iandir.  

- The saint/demigod Calaera no longer acts as an independent deity, and no
longer issues sigils or god touches.  

- The sacrifice and god touch mechanics have both been significantly
[Hit Return to continue]

revised.  Please see HELP SACRIFICE and HELP GOD TOUCH for more information.

- The Guardians of Law are no longer a Great House.  - The role of Great
Houses and their criteria for joining has changed.  Please see HELP GREAT
HOUSE for more information.  

- Kankoran are in the process of being removed entirely from Avendar and
their existence retconned.  Kankoran NPCs still exist for now as do
references to kankoran, but all are in the process of being rewritten, and
new kankoran PCs may not be made.  Please see HELP KANKORAN for more
information.  

- Most lineages have been given significant expansions to their histories,
cultures, and/or aesthetics.  Please see the relevant help files and the
wiki for more information.  

Updates to our in-game help files to accurately represent added skills,
spells, and other mechanical changes are in progress.  In the mean time,
please check out our website or direct any questions to our Discord.  

Thanks for playing with us, we hope you have fun.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

Inside the Gates
  Past the wrought iron gates is a wide corridor with walls cut from solid
granite blocks, lit by mounted white globes.  The entry corridor is
surprisingly simple for such a vast and well-known establishment, as it
bears no notable ornamentation.  The School's foyer awaits to the north,
opening up from the corridor's enclosure into a vast chamber.  To the south
lies the School's entrance.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of

East Qalnistra Street
  This street runs east and west through Old Earendam, cutting a precise
line through the buildings and side streets which line the way.  Paved with
polished Brintor stones, the well-tended street nevertheless shows signs of
age, having carried the weights of both the traditions and the bodies of the
city's scholars and aristocrats for time immemorial.  South of here is the
entrance to the hall of the Company of the Pegasus, one of Earendam's
chartered fighting companies, while to the north, a small side street heads
between a row of buildings.

East Corvandil Square
  The east part of Corvandil Square serves as a gateway to East Qalnistra
Street, allowing noblemen and the occasional guardsman access to this square
which stands astride the south gates of the city.  Longer than it is wide,
Corvandil's glazed cobblestones are bordered by a series of fountains, each
adorning one corner of the square.  West of here is the central part of the
square, where an enormous marble statue towers above the square.

Center of Corvandil Square
  Near the center of Corvandil Square, this area is dominated by a marble
statue of epic proportions.  Standing over ten feet in height, the statue
depicts the city's first ruling Patrician, Corvandil, clad in the regalia of
an Earendam's nobility.  Corvandil Square connects the two halves of the
southern part of Earendam, as well as providing access to the city's south
gate.  Ringing the square are ornamental fountains, each inset in a corner
of the square.

Meticulously carved and cared for, the temple is devoid of the gold and
silver ornaments found in temples to other gods, but in the frieze above the
entranceway, the characters of the bas relief are lined with diamond, and
the center depicts the sapphire spear, symbolically represented by an
enormous sapphire.

Inside a Temple to Jolinn
  The interior of Earendam's temple to Jolinn is daunting in its size. 
Topped by a dome of bluish marble, the room is illuminated by the glass
oculus that breaks the surface of the roof.  Light reflects on the carved
mosaic in the floor, which depicts the precepts of Jolinn in shades of
sapphire and inlaid mother-of-pearl.  A rival even to Iandir's prevalent
religion in this city, Jolinn's temple is tended by an ancient group of
clergymen, and maintained by the city's wealthier patrons.  To the west, an
altar is set upon an illuminated dais, while alcoves lead north and south
out of this massive chamber.

stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open

that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Winding Mountain Road
  The Brintor Road narrows into a winding mountain path, twisting its way

The chaja were the first lineage to settle the Brintor mountains,
building many great towering stone spires in homage to their starry goddess,
Kyana.  In obeisance to her foresight, they retreated underground enmasse,
establishing isolated strongholds within the mountains.  Soon after their
exodus, the aelin would settle in their former homes, mistaking their
majestic spires for alatharyan ruins; they would be scoured to dust within
centuries by the War of Fire.  

Chaja are now a largely subterranean people within the Brintors, their
mastery of the druidic arts transforming their underground caverns into
sunlit, verdant spaces.  The influences of the gods Elanthe and Kurion
alongside Kyana have made them a stoic people .  Owing to their isolation,
chaja are known outside the mountains for their frequent use as slaves by
the shuddeni, particularly during the War of Night when they were forced to
be shock troops.  The shuddeni continue to predate upon the chaja,
kidnapping them for enslavement as laborers, hunters, or servants.  Crude
stereotypes and lingering prejudice have made chaja lives in outside cities
such as Earendam or Ashta Harrud frustrating ones.  They can frequently be
found commiserating with alatharya, who experience similar prejudices.  

Ranging between six and eight feet tall, chaja are quite stout and vaguely
caprine in appearance, with flat noses and small blunt horns often hidden in
their thick, wooly hair ranging in colour from cream to brown to black. 
They are quite hirsute, often growing mantles of long shaggy hair across
their shoulders, chest, and back, and both sexes may grow beards.  Young
chaja have much lighter hair and skin that darkens with age, and their eyes
are either colourless or very pale, without a visible pupil or sclera.  The
lingering blessing of Kyana allows chaja to see perfectly in darkness, and
they can eat almost anything without ill effect.  Their stature allows them
to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.

The Mining Camp
  This stretch of cave is crowded with mining equipment, bedrolls for
several men, provisions, and various clutter.  Apparently this is the
temporary camp of a mining party.  Further evidence lies in a mine shaft
sunk into the west wall of the cave, and three mine carts partially filled
with ore.  The main cave continues north and south.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the east is Center Square.  

[Exits: east south west]

<129hp 114m 29mv> 
Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

  Lifalin's shop is completed devoted to the craft of archery.  Bows of
stout ash are interspersed with those made from lighter yew.  Along with the
bows, several finely tooled leather quivers hold arrows of several different
varieties, all neatly arranged and fletched with light brown feathers.  The
shop has few places to sit, aside from a small chair behind the counter.

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

This young woman is gaunt, sharp cheekbones accentuating the hollows of
her cheeks.  Her hair is cropped close to her head, short and neat enough to
require careful maintenance.  Her frame is a little too big for her apparent
weight, suggesting some number of missed meals.  She is neither particularly
tall nor notably short, being of decidedly average height.  Similarly her
complexion is just tan enough that she could be from almost anywhere north
of Harrud inclusive, and she shows no obvious cosmetics, though a faint
textural abberation implies a concealed mole of some sort just above her
left jawline.

made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded

|          Watcher                                                          |

The modern watcher is the culmination of a tri-racial melting pot, but
its heart belongs squarely to the shuddeni.  While the roots of their staff
mastery certainly are aelin, as is the desire to oversee one's lessers, it
was the eyeless which brought new, and powerful, psychic abilities to bear
in its furtherence.  Emboldened by Rveyelhi, watchers hold a prominent role
in the trade city of Var Bandor, where their headquarters, the enigmatic
Office of Records, is located.  The nefortu have brought with them a degree
of unusual trickery, giving watchers an edge at provoking, or quelling,
unexpected conflict.  Together, these forces have created one of Avendar's
most powerful mercenary guilds.  

A watcher's chosen weapon is the staff, and his mastery of its use is beyond
all others.  While wielding his staff, a watcher is adept at rapid strikes,
stunning twirls, and superior deflection.  He is also a hunter, able to
locate people with remote viewing and delay or weaken those he has caught up
with.  However, the most insidious weapon in a watcher's arsenal is his
affiliation with the monolithic Office of Records, which grants access to
information on individuals, from the superficial to the specific.  When of
sufficient rank, a watcher may choose to add to the Office's collective
knowledge, or employ it against those who have earned his disfavor.  

The watcher guild is bound by order, as well as confidentiality therefore,
those of chaotic ethoi cannot study within it.  Watchers often venerate
lawful deities because of their guild's bias in that direction, and have
many have sought the Guardians of Law.  However, with the coming of
Rveyelhi, Tyrant of the Black Staff, the watcher guild has taken on a less
upstanding cast, giving its machinations a crueler bent.  In the end, a
watcher's allegiance is for sale...  To those willing to pay.
