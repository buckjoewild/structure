Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

  Surrounded by newly constructed buildings, Commerce Street winds through
the merchant quarter of Var Bandor.  All around are signs of great wealth,
the gold that flows from the prosperous trade evident in the buildings, the
clothing of the citizens, and the meticulous maintenance of the streets.  To
the north is an elegant inn, and to the east is Ilrin Street.

barred windows, scrutinizing their clientele.  Plants and small wooden

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the south is the central square of

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

  The waters of the Uthlin Ocean spread before you like gray slate, an
occasional wave tossing the driftwood and seaweed about.  To the south, the
coast of Earendam can be seen.  The salty air blows about you, carrying a
slight chill with it, a slight hint of the colder climes to the north.

Main Deck of the Kkesiruant
  The main deck of the Kkesiruant stretches before you, remarkably clean
and free of clutter.  While necessary supplies remain at hand, the cargo
seems stowed away elsewhere.  The forecastle deck rises to the north, its
towering foremast and lance-like bowsprit piercing the ocean air.  The rope
shrouds binding the masts and sails sway with the ship, and ratlines lead
upward into a maze of dark, fluttering canvas.  To the south, the main deck
continues toward the stern.

  A steep seaside cliff rises above the waters of the Uthlin Ocean,

  The path winds to a dead end here at a small clearing, partially

seraph has been carved deeply into the stone.  The simple relief is starkly
effective, portraying a slender seraph with three pairs of wings.  Below
you, the rocky cliffs rise straight out of the deep, turbulent water of the
Uthlin Ocean, constantly pounded by surf.  The chill sea winds whip about
noisily.  In the clouds above, feathered shapes cavort and call.  To the

This stone statue of a four-winged seraph has been carved from the same
textured grey stone as the cliffs, though some magic or art has preserved it
from the erosive powers which pit and crumble the cliffs themselves. 
Chiseled with a fine, though not detailed, hand, the seraph has one leg
solidly on the cliff, raised on the ball of the foot.  The other is extended
mid-leap.  The seraph's wings are spread dramatically, facing eastward, and
both arms are extended as for a loving embrace.

with long streaks of golden paint.  The effect is peculiar, giving the areas
so covered an opacity the rest of him does not share.  A dedicant of the
goddess Calaera, he spends his time at Her holy site, selling devotional
necklaces to approaching seekers.

A Mountainside Shrine
  The path winds to a dead end here at a small clearing, partially
sheltered by the weathered grey rock of the cliffs.  At the back of the
recess a white slab of veined marble forms a simple altar behind it, a tall
seraph has been carved deeply into the stone.  The simple relief is starkly
effective, portraying a slender seraph with three pairs of wings.  Below
you, the rocky cliffs rise straight out of the deep, turbulent water of the
Uthlin Ocean, constantly pounded by surf.  The chill sea winds whip about
noisily.  In the clouds above, feathered shapes cavort and call.  To the
south, a dangerous path leads around a bend in the cliff face.

A Narrow Path Over the Bay
  This narrow path hugs the cliff face, curving its way along to the north.
Far below, the cold Uthlin Ocean beats endlessly against the rocky
shoreline.  No landing is available in the dark waters.  The surf and
shoreline both gentle further to the north.  The path continues along the
cliff, becoming less precarious forward and behind.  The air is chilly and
rich with the tang of sea salt.  Vigorous wind blows along the coastline,
and feathered shapes cavort in the clouds above.

A Cliff High Above the Ocean
  A narrow cliff face lines the highest portion of the mountain,
overlooking the Uthlin Ocean far below.  Beneath, two other stone ledges are
visible protruding from the sheer mountain.  The winds at this altitude are
quite brisk, blowing dust and large feathers into swirling eddies.  A layer
of white clouds conceals the mountain peak overhead.  A path hugs the cliff
face, heading north around a slight curve.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Monkey'

A less-extreme variant of the form of the reed, form of the monkey is also
used to enhance a swordmaster's defensive capability. Less pronounced in all
regards, the swordmaster will still see a marked increase in his ability to
parry and offhand parry, and he will be unable to attempt to make a fourth
attack in a combat round.

Activation lag  :  1.0 rounds
Activation cost :  20 mana

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Mongoose'

Imitating the exotic mongoose, this notoriously stylish form allows a
swordmaster to strike successively in combat, for each blow he attempts to
land. These attacks may miss or be blocked as with any other.

Activation lag  :  1.0 rounds
Activation cost :  20 mana
Maintenance cost:  20 mana per round


Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Reed'

In the form of the reed, the swordmaster focuses all of abilities on using
his weapon to beat back his opponents attack.  Bending like a reed in the
wind, his ability to both parry and offhand parry is doubled.  However, this
level of focus means that he is then unable to attempt second, third, or
fourth attacks, and will lower the amount of damage dealt by a meditative
strike.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Wasp'

This form is characterized by its sharp, piercing strikes deep into an
opponent's bodies. Each such blow will cause his opponent to bleed profusely.
These bleeding wounds may be cured. Additional strikes do not extend the
duration.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Viper'

Using their already precise striking ability, swordmasters can use the form of
the viper to inflict strategic hits against an opponent, dealing damage to
both strength and dexterity. The pinprick nature of the wounds means they
cannot be healed except simply by waiting. The effects of this form are
cumulative.

The form of the mockingbird is used for the purposes of countering other
warriors' attack skills. The majority of those used by fighters, gladiators,

motions pulling opponents up short.

Modelling this offensive form after the legendary dragons, a swordmaster in

Your description is:
A whip-thin, dark-skinned caladaran stoops here.  His face and skin, from
what show in gaps of his piecemeal armor, is dark brown and rugged and rough
as old oak bark.  His seemingly tough textured skin grows even thicker and
darker towards each of his joints.  His idly passive demeanor and often
downcast gaze make him seem humble or unobtrusive but bright green eyes
shimmer intelligently.  His lithe frame moves with the ease of obvious
training and he seems to usually gravitate towards empty space.  Lastly you
regard the two blades secured fast about his right side.  Varying in sizes
and work the two swords are bound in scabbards.  The hilt of each blade is
fairly close together and, at rest, hang low on his waist.  One of his
calloused hands seems to constantly linger about the hilt of one of the two
blades.  Overall he lurks, slinks, lingers in an attempt to be
inconspicious.

terrain is very important over reacts to any weather adding this gem of a
document for posterity --------------------------------------------- The
quiet village had little in the way of ornamental decoration.  The buildings
seemed well-crafted but, seemed more than anything, built for a purpose. 
The circular pattern of the place seemed to conceal the the place from
itself.  Attempting to wander from one building to another was an effort.  A
little over a dozen of the structures, total, veljik caught the eye of every
single one.  His trek from Yithoul had been a long one and he anticipated
this to be only the beginning.  

As he moved through the walkways half sliding his feet the a simple truth
dawned on him.  In this place, the hidden blade is the most powerful.  He
understood why he was exiled from his race.  A soft rustle brings his hands
around, lesser ak'aginta unwavering, a low kick that seemed to materialize
from the shadows.  His eyeless gaze turned to sense an overwhelming amount
of activity around him.  Several punches from countless directions pummeled
him.  As he struggled the unrelenting hands pushed him to unconciousness

"Why are you here?"  The old caladaran asked.  

"Ak'aginta."  He replied, as he habitually adjusted his underwrapping.  Such
precautions had protected him from the Star since his wandering here. 
Keeping his head turned slightly in deference Veljik continued, "You have
taught me much already."  "What do you believe of the circle?"  The
caladaran continued, fact stoic.  The two faces turned, mirroring each other
in demeanor, a sharp contrast drawn in physical appearance.  "It is the end
with the beginning.  It is the beginning with the end.  It is perfect." 
Veljik rasped.  The Grandmaster rose smoothly.  Veljik remained seated head
deferred to the wooden floor.  "Begin training, with the ginta'am'akan as
well then, Veljik v'Edaris."  The old caladaran left the room, a piece of
paper left where he was once seated.

A Nesting Cave
  The griffin nesting tunnel continues to twist through the stone of the
cliff wall.  The cave walls are smoothed over from the passing of countless
bodies, and the floor is coated with a layer of guano and large feathers.

The caladaran are reknowned throughout Avendar for their wisdom.  Tall,
gentle creatures with odd bark-like skin, they tend to live either in
forests or among the mountains, where they are known for their secluded
lifestyles. Recently, however, many Caladaran have been known to descend
into the towns, mixing with civilization and crowds. Few in number, the
Caladaran are long-lived and reknowned for their skills as sages, refusing
direct physical confrontation.

Due to this tendency to avoid physical violence and to seek a more spiritual
mode of existence, caladaran tend to regain health less rapidly than other
races. However, this passive mode of existence allows more time for
meditation, allowing mental energy to be regained more rapidly.
    
Caladaran may be good or neutral, and may not be chaotic in nature. They may
become bards, druids, psionicists, and scholars.

Caladaran receive 4 practices per level.

NOTE: After this and any death, you will experience some time as a ghost.
In this state, you can interact only minimally with the world or other characters.
However, during this time, you may safely return to your corpse and retrieve the items
you had.  If you know how to reach your corpse, this should be your first course of
action.  If you don't, your items may still return to your recall altar after awhile,
assuming no one has stolen them.

You should seek out a healer, and attempt to resurrect within the next 20 RL minutes
by typing 'heal resurrect'.  If adequate time has transpired since your demise,
you will resume your normal form.  Make sure you resurrect within that time frame
for if you linger in your ghostly form too long, you may find your spirit more apt
to journey away from this plane.  See 'help DEATH' for more.

You have been KILLED!!
You have returned as a ghost, for the moment.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

all been carved into complicated piece of statuery.  The tall columns give

Earendam.  Passing between the city's mercantile district to the north, and
the old city to the south, the river is one of the principal avenues for
trade into and out of the city.  The waters of the Dantaron are deep here,
clouded by the dark mud of its bottom, and the frequent river-traffic along
its course.  To the east, the Dantaron flows under a high arched bridge.

move immediately.  An occasional raft or barge can be seen on the river,
arriving or leaving the city.  To the east, the granite walls of Earendam

<46hp 96m 260mv> A Cliff Overlooking the Ocean
  The rocky cliffs rise steeply above the seaside, the sound of crashing
waves echoing off the jagged walls.  The smell of salt is in the air, and
far overhead, indistinct avians circle through the sky.  A natural stone
shelf juts from the cliff face, leading to the west, and climbing upwards.  

[Exits: west up]
A small griffin flexes its wings as it pads back and forth along the ledge.

A Stone Shelf, High Above the Ocean
  A smooth shelf of stone protrudes from the jagged cliff face,
overshadowing the cliffs below.  A chill breeze blows along the shelf,
carrying with it the scent of seawater as well as a large amount of dust and
large feathers.  Overhead, another shelf of stone protrudes from the wall of
the cliff, and high in the sky above can be seen indistinct avians, swirling
and diving.

[Exits: west up down]
A human walks fearlessly among the griffins.

A Cliff High Above the Ocean
  A narrow cliff face lines the highest portion of the mountain,
overlooking the Uthlin Ocean far below.  Beneath, two other stone ledges are
visible protruding from the sheer mountain.  The winds at this altitude are
quite brisk, blowing dust and large feathers into swirling eddies.  A layer
of white clouds conceals the mountain peak overhead.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate

intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  A pair of flaming braziers are
near the southern doorway, which burn red from the light of the smoking
coals.  The air is filled with the cloying smell of myrrh, which drifts

off the way to the south, except where a high arched wooden bridge splits
off from the road to cross the Dantaron.  The entirety of the north side of
the street is taken up with a temple of blocks carved from obsidian.  Tall
black steps lead up to the entrance, which is framed by columns, which have
all been carved into complicated piece of statuery.  The tall columns give
the building a gigantic feel, and it seems to tower over the entire street.

are clear of clutter, incoming cargo being regulated closely and required to
move immediately.  An occasional raft or barge can be seen on the river,
arriving or leaving the city.  To the east, the granite walls of Earendam
tower above the dock area.  Several ladders and wooden walkways lead
downward to the water of the river itself.

The West Gate of Earendam
  Earendam's west gates are made of sturdy iron, built between two tall
stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

  A narrow strip of stones that leads north into the grasslands, the

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

Center of Tyril Square
  The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way begins here, serving as a throughway for the scholars
and craftsman who travel to and from Tyril Square to the west and the
artisan's district of Earendam further east.  To the south of the street,
marble stairs lead up to enter some sort of scholar's shop, while the
building to the north is less ostentatious, being a simple stone block
guarded by gate archways.  Home to the Company of the Ram, the building
houses one of Earendam's chartered mercenary companies.

Elrith's Armory
  Elrith's Armory specializes in the fine plate armors produced by the
artisans and earth scholars of Earendam, providing wares for the cities
wealthier nobility.  With most of the merchandise furnished by the artisans
in the surrounding parts of the city, the shop lacks the forge common in
most such places.  The north part of the room is taken up with a counter,
beside which a full set of field plate is arranged on a pole.  A pine door
leads through a wall to the west, and the way onto the street lies south.  

[Exits: south west]
Elrith carefully polishes a piece of armor.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Lining the street are shops bearing the products of the
craftsmen who work in this part of the city.  To the south is a jeweller's
shop, which is successful enough to have a plate glass window to display its
wares.  The armorer's shop to the north has no such trappings, but
nevertheless bears the symbols of its wares on a stout wooden sign.  Frinian
comes to an end to the east, but continues along its current path to the

Frinian Way
  Frinian Way is a broad but winding street which heads east and west as it
makes its way through New Earendam.  Scholars, artisans and other craftsmen
use this street, bringing their goods from the east part of the city to
service the mercantile activity in the Arien Plaza.  The buildings lining
this street appear of more recent construction than the cobblestones of
Frinian, which shows the marks of what could only be nigh on hundreds of
years of wear.  In contrast, the surrounding buildings, while hewn from the
Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  Past an arched gateway to
the north, a low, squat building houses the Company of the Jackal, one of
Earendam's chartered guard companies.  To the east, Frinian comes to a halt
as it widens into Tyril Square.

of ak'anginta: "thought-to-form", in which the sword becomes an extension of
self, with each style an expression.  Using these "ginta" or "forms", a
swordmaster becomes one of Avendar's most formidable combatants, displaying a
mastery of his weapon unparalleled by any other.  The roots of ak'anginta are
often claimed by the aelin, its graceful and aesthetically pleasing motions
expressing the highest ideals of their storied culture.  However, over time,
other races have left their mark on the profession's practice, be it in the
cruel precision of the shuddeni or the brutal power of the srryn.

Individual swordmasters often find personal affinity to a single form early
in training.  However, swordplay is as flexible as it is unique, leading many
to take great pride in mastering a variety of styles.  Additionally, the
trained ambidexterity offered by this path allows for greater diversity in
sword selection than other warriors.  Because of their dedication to a single
sword, longer-lived and more broadly experienced swordmasters are able to
vastly outclass swordsmen of other professions.

A deeply aesthetic art, aelin swordmasters of good alignment often favor
Aeolis as a deity, while evil practitioners occasionally offer secret homage
to Serachel.  These affinities can also apply to other races as well,
especially those whose study heightens their appreciation for aelin culture.
However, the path of the ginta is often as deeply individual as its students,
making common swordmasters of all faiths, or none.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

There are ten sapient species, or lineages, in the world of Avendar. All
trace their origins to the intervention or shaping of one or more gods. 

Human    : Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.
Aelin    : Slight with feathered wings, known for grace and pride.
Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.
Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions.
Chaja    : Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns.
Ch'taren : Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.
Ethron   : Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.
Nefortu  : Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.
Shuddeni : Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.
Srryn    : Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.

All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do not
exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical maturity
for their lineage, which may vary between species. More detailed information
may be found in each lineage's helpfiles.

The alatharya were the First People: the first lineage created and
endowed by Jolinn with true free will.  During the eons of their dominance,
they colonized the whole of Avendar, creating many wondrous cities and
artefacts of incredible and now-impossible power, many of which endure and
are greatly coveted to the modern day.  According to the most commonly known
legends, the alatharya in their hubris attempted to challenge the supremacy
of the Overgods.  The First People were cast down by the heavens, and the
ensuing cataclysm-- known as the Sundering-- radically changed the face of
the land and destroyed the legendary power of the alatharya forever.  

The alatharya were stripped of their peerless magical capabilities, forever
rendered magically and resonantly inert.  With the loss of their magic and
the utter destruction of their civilization, the alatharya only survived the
Sundering and the harsh, frozen centuries that followed due to the
intervention of Enirra.  They adapted well to the wilds with the aid of the
ethron, and together established the earliest arts of the Ranger and
Barbarian.  

Physically, the alatharya are enormous humanoids with silvery skin of
varying shades and pure white hair, which they frequently dye.  A typical
alatharya averages nine feet tall, with a broad chest and heavily muscled
limbs with very little body fat.  Their sheer size gives them some
resistance to physical blows and allows them to heft some two-handed weapons
in a single hand.  Their eyesight is incredibly keen, allowing them to see
and aim a weapon farther than most others.

Your statistics (stats) determine the degree of your character's physical and
mental aptitudes.  Stats range from 3-25, and all characters will have -5 to
their lineage maximums at level 1, then gain 1 to all stats every 10 levels
until 50. Statistics can be temporarily improved by items or affects, and
bonuses to your stats will offset debuffs. The specific effects of each stat
are listed in their helpfiles; your stats have no impact on the effectiveness
of your skills, HP/MP/MV gain, etc, only what is listed.

The Dantaron Vault
  The Dantaron Vault is one of Earendam's leading banks, claiming a
thousand year history and a magically impenetrable vault to hide the
valuables of its owners.  Its furnishings are as lavish as its reputation
suggests: plush couches provide seating for the bank's patrons, and the
attendants work from behind gilded bars.  The bank's primary exit lies
through an archway to the south.

Exotic flora fills the chamber, growing from pots or troughs, and even

<264hp 430m 219mv> East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Lining the street are shops bearing the products of the
craftsmen who work in this part of the city.  To the south is a jeweller's
shop, which is successful enough to have a plate glass window to display its
wares.  The weapon maker's shop to the north has no such trappings, but
nevertheless bears the symbols of its wares on a stout wooden sign.  Frinian
continues much the same to both the east and west.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Every character has a maximum amount of weight they can carry; approaching
this limit too closely will begin to incur encumbrance penalties.
Additionally, equipment worn on the hands, torso, and arms can encumber the
wearer, regardless of how much is carried.

Maximum carry weight and maximum equipment weight are largely determined by
the strength statistic; more is always better.

The degrees of encumbrance are: unencumbered, lightly-encumbered, encumbered,
and heavily-encumbered.  Being over your maximum carry weight has further
penalties, but this is largely only possible if you have taken penalties to
your strength.

Unencumbered characters act normally, suffering no penalties.

The penalties for encumbrance are as follows:

Light encumbrance: This status simply serves as a warning.

Encumbered: Encumbered characters will receive a small penalty to their
ability to cast, failing occasionally.  They will also receive a 1-point
dexterity penalty and incur higher movement costs.

Heavy encumbrance: Characters under heavy encumbrance will fail attempts to
cast spells a little more often.  They will take a 3-point penalty to
dexterity, feel higher movement point costs, and have a slightly higher amount
of lag when moving from room to room.

Characters over their maximum carry weight will fail spells even more often,
take a 5-point penalty to dexterity, and as above, will have heightened
movement costs and increased lag when moving.

Characters will be notified any time their encumbrance state changes; it may
also be checked with the SCORE command and WORTH commands.

Vandar's Blades
  Vandar's Blades is a well-furnished shop, offering the wares created by
the craftsman who inhabit the artisan's district of Earendam.  With no forge
in evidence, the shop is remarkably comfortable, offering a wide variety of
weapons on display on the walls behind the counter that takes up the north
half of the room.  The wall to the east is rather thin, and is broken by a
pine door.  A doorway also leads southward onto Frinian Way, which runs in
past the front of the shop.

East Frinian Way
  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Lining the street are shops bearing the products of the
craftsmen who work in this part of the city.  To the south is a jeweller's
shop, which is successful enough to have a plate glass window to display its
wares.  The weapon maker's shop to the north has no such trappings, but
nevertheless bears the symbols of its wares on a stout wooden sign.  Frinian
continues much the same to both the east and west.

  The entrance hall to the Company of the Ram is a well-tended place, with
a martial aura about it.  The brick walls and floors of the place are free
of the typical dust and rubbish of a fighting company, with even the
masonry's cracks and nicks kept mended.  Arched portcullises lead east and
west, and the street lies through a southern entranceway.  North of the
entrance is the main body of this compound.

East of Tyril Square
  The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

<337hp 430m 254mv> 
Center of Tyril Square
  The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

The Weapon Gallery
  This portion of the base floor is walled off from the Gallery of Heroes,
and houses many of the great weapons of the War of Night.  The high stone
walls are mounted with globes of light, which forever light the interior of
the chamber.  Low platforms are placed throughout it, with the various
artifacts placed upon them.  A barrier of pulsing blue light covers each,
shielding the weapons from the effects of time, or simple thievery.  A
silver plaque is affixed to the base of each platform, describing what it
holds.  The chamber continues west and south.

The Gallery of Heroes
  The ceiling for the base floor of the tower extends nearly twenty feet
into the air, supported by dark stone columns.  Orbs of smokeless orange
light, high above, are mounted upon the pillars, casting their light
throughout the floor.  Set into the nearby pillar is an oil painting of
Ilciryas, Ranger-King of Qilarn.  A golden plaque beneath it describes the
Eqiril clan's defense of the forest.  The tile floor is well-swept, and the
air is still with reverence.  Heavy wooden doors lead both to the north and
south.  The Gallery of Heroes continues to the west, while the exit to the
tower is east.

An Entrance to the High Tower
  A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the west, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain wind
whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The path
continues north and south, while to the east, another path branches off to
the temple of Kor Thrandir.  To the west, a large door leads into the keep
itself.

  Large, wooden barricades line the southern path, ensuring that the
training areas for the Kor Thrandian soldiers and archers remain both
contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible
beyond the barricades.  To the north, the keep of Kor Thrandir dominates the

  The training grounds of Kor Thrandir are a hodgepodge of activity,
mottled grass, and hard-packed dirt.  The shouts of battle and the clash of
wooden weapons split the air, and the heavy scent of sweat drifts by on the
mountain wind.  There are no trees within the training ground, making it a
thoroughly open expanse enclosed by heavy wooden barricades.  A rise in the

officer, while pairs of soldiers spar on the grassy turf below it.  To the

those of the trampled grasses and mountain wind, mix alternatingly with the
passing of the breeze.  To the west, young Thrandian soldiers practice their
martial skills, while to the east is the archery range.  The path continues

which are trampled low by the passage of Kor Thrandir's archers.  There are
no trees within the range itself, leaving plenty of open space for target
practice and preparation.  Wooden barricades surround the field, separating
it to keep most of the arrows in.  The wind is light and surprisingly clear,
with the sounds of snapping bows and striking arrows drifting upon it.  The

contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible
beyond the barricades.  To the north, the keep of Kor Thrandir dominates the

tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the north, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain
wind whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The

Rakinal, the kankoran chieftain during the War of Night.  A golden plaque
beneath it describes his contribution to the war effort.  The tile floor is

<66hp 109m 216mv> The Armor Gallery
  This portion of the base floor is walled off from the Gallery of Heroes,
and houses many of the famous pieces of armor from the heroes of the War of
Night.  The high stone walls are mounted with globes of light, which forever
light the interior of the chamber.  Low platforms are placed throughout it,
with the various artifacts placed upon them.  A barrier of pulsing blue
light covers each, shielding the armor from the effects of time, or simple
thievery.  A silver plaque is affixed to the base of each platform,
describing what it holds.  The chamber continues north and east, while a

An Entrance to the High Tower
  A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the north, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain
wind whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The
path continues east and west, while to the south, another path branches off
to the practice fields and schools.  To the north, a large door leads into
the keep itself.

The Southern Path
  Large, wooden barricades line the southern path, ensuring that the
training areas for the Kor Thrandian soldiers and archers remain both
contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible
beyond the barricades.  To the north, the keep of Kor Thrandir dominates the
skyline.
