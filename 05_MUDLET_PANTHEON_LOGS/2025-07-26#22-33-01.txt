  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

The Wheelwright's
  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Mongoose'

Imitating the exotic mongoose, this notoriously stylish form allows a
swordmaster to strike successively in combat, for each blow he attempts to
land. These attacks may miss or be blocked as with any other.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

The Wheelwright's
  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.

The Blacksmith
  It's thrice hotter inside the blacksmith's than it is on the street.  A
thick curtain of smoke hangs in the air, and metal shavings cover the floor.
Three large, hot furnaces are built into the far wall, creating the immense
heat of this room.  An anvil and hammer sit off near the far corner, along
with a barrel full of cool water.  A large pile of scrap metal sits off in
one corner, waiting to be molded into something.  North leads from the near
unbearable temperature back unto the street.

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

An armed enforcer of Var Bandor patrols here.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

     A simple pine staff lies on the ground.
     A large marble fountain gurgles peacefully here.

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the east is Center Square.

abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and

rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

golden light.
