The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.  

[Exits: north east south west down]
     A wooden one-man canoe sits here.
(Translucent) A magic mouth hovers in mid-air, grinning nonchalantly.

  A large room of the upper floor of Krilin Fortress has been set aside for
the worship of various deities of light.  The chapel is simply decorated,
with plain wooden pews and a few holy symbols decorating the walls.  At the

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

opening up from the corridor's enclosure into a vast chamber.  To the south

Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room's north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer's entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School's
iron gates.

  This branch of the Hall of Arms includes the same pale stone and gilded
ceiling as its northern counterpart.  The room itself uses furniture
sparingly, offering a bench along the western wall for students to sit.  A
counter lines the south wall, made of polished wood.  The walls and the
front of the counter are decorated with various examples of the School's
in-house wares, including copper mail, shields, and cloth or hide
stitchwork.  The armory is well-lit and well-maintained on all accounts.  To

stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly

  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy

pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous

stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street

skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the

A Breezy Stairwell
  This stairwell is on the far north side of the second floor of the Tower
of Testing.  It is rugged and dark, lit with flickering torches.  As the
stairs descend back to the first level, the air becomes colder and more
dank.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing the
flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and smooth,
suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the lizard habitat
on the second floor of the Tower of Testing, while the first floor lay
below.

The Beginning of the Second Floor
  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor is generally shaped
like a cross, with two long intersecting hallways.  The floor here is the
same rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This hallway continues south, while the
stairwell to the first floor lies to the north.

droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This area serves as a point of
intersection between the two hallways of the floor, with one going east and

A Glass Stairwell
  The second floor comes to an end with a stairwell leading upward.  The
tower here begins a transition away from the rough-hewn stone of the lower
levels toward white brick and tile, much like that of the School of Heroes. 
The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor below, with high glass
panels that follow the stairs as they proceed further up.  From here you
have a pleasant but commanding view of Avendar's distant horizons, with
vents letting in further fresh air from above.  The stairway is

clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose

A Corner on the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  The hall turns here, with its exits to the west and
south.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell leads upward to the fourth floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The white stones of the third level end at the entrance to this
stairwell, instead replaced by the iconic marble of the School's main level.
The tile floor looks less worn and of a higher sheen, and the stairwell
itself is polished to a high gloss.  Arched windows look out onto the world
at large, high enough to give the faint of heart a bit of pause.  The sounds
of battle ring out from the floor above.  The long hall of the third floor
lies to the north.

School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

A Stone Stairwell
  A stone stairwell leads upward toward the fifth floor, just on the other
side of the large tiled arena of the fourth.  The arched windows and heavy
construction suggest that this is one of the oldest remaining parts of the
Tower of Testing, the stone worn smooth by a thousand years of young
adventurers.  The stairs are smooth and even, and worn in the center from
the crossing of many footsteps.  Torches light the stairwell, giving it the
same shadowy cast as some of the lowest floors of the School and Tower.  The
fifth floor awaits above, while the tests of battle are to the west.

  The fifth floor is among the oldest parts of the Tower of Testing, built
of heavy, rough-hewn stone.  The arched windows and smooth, worn stone
suggest the passage of untold adventurers over many generations, the floor
clear of debris and signs of disrepair.  Old stains of blood mark the stone
walls, and heavy iron lanterns hang from the ceiling to light the corridor. 
A large door leads to the south, its frame secure and marked with runic
wards.  The stairwell lies to the north, while this level of the Tower

A Small Granite Chamber
  This stone chamber is built from smooth blocks of pale granite, four
bracketed torches ensconced on each wall.  The ceiling is high and largely
oddly disorienting, as the floor and walls are all the same color and
texture.  The air is cool and crisp, tinged with a hint of magical energy. 
There are no apparent exits in any direction, making the low ceiling seem
even more claustrophobic.

walls largely absent, the high roof held aloft by mighty stone columns.  A
barrier of energy surrounds the enclosure, allowing the passing breeze and
cool air of the Tower's great height.  The marble floor is covered in a
rich, burgundy carpet, with gold-mounted orbs of light illuminating the
room.  The view outside is little more than a cloudscape, with the sun and
moons clearly visible to occupants.  The chamber continues to the south.

The Roof of the Tower of Testing
  The high roof of the Tower is shielded by a barely perceptible field of
magic, but otherwise is entirely unencumbered.  It includes a large central
platform, upon which six slender spires rise, matching a convex hexagon's
points.  The golden staircase from below arrives between two of such spires,
allowing admission to the platform.  The glittering stone of the rooftop
shines in both sunlight and moonlight, and the shrill wind whips between the
spires.  The surrounding skyscape is above the clouds, their wispy expanse
making the roof seem more like an island in a white sea.  A large orb sits
at the center of the platform, beckoning you.  The only apparent exit is
down the golden stairs.

A Small Delivery Office
  This small office is walled with the same white-stone blocks as are used

with hanging burgundy tapestries, giving it a richer, more mercantile feel. 
A small wooden desk and chair sit against the western wall, bearing a tiny
inkwell and quill-stand.  The ceiling is low and plain, the light from the
sconces playing across its uneven surface.  Open doorways lead out of the
office to the north and south, with the northern portal shimmering with

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

Inside the Gates
  Past the wrought iron gates is a wide corridor with walls cut from solid
granite blocks, lit by mounted white globes.  The entry corridor is
surprisingly simple for such a vast and well-known establishment, as it
bears no notable ornamentation.  The School's foyer awaits to the north,
opening up from the corridor's enclosure into a vast chamber.  To the south
lies the School's entrance.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

Office of Applied Theology
  The office exudes an air of cold formality, dominated by sleek white
marble walls and polished floors that reflect the bright light of hanging
magelights.  The western wall features an expansive mural depicting the
liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment
feels almost sterile, both imposing and inescapable despite the large double
doors perpetually open to Dantaron street.

  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is

within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

seems a little quieter.  A small wooden stage rises up on the west wall for
entertainers, but it shows signs of disuse.  The entrance to the bar is
east, while some scattered tables are south.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
east is Sadrent Road.

    map basics (quick start guide)
    ----------------------------------------

    Mudlet Mapper works in tandem with a script, and this generic mapper script needs
    to know 2 things to work:
      - room name ✔️ (In the Tables)
      - exits     ✔️ (up east north)

    1. start mapping <optional area name>
       If both room name and exits are good, you can start mapping! Give it the
       area name you're currently in, usually optional but required for the first one.
    2. find prompt
       Room name or exits aren't recognised? Try this command then. It will make
       the script start looking for a prompt using several standard prompt
       patterns. If a prompt is found, you will be notified, if not, you will
       need to set a prompt pattern yourself using map prompt.
       Reach out to the Mudlet community for help, we'd be happy to help
       you figure it out!
    3. map debug
       This toggles debug mode. When on, messages will be displayed showing what
       information is captured and a few additional error messages that can help
       with getting the script fully compatible with your game.
    4. map help
       This will bring up a more detailed help file, starting with the available
       help topics.

In the Tables
  The tables are scattered around the room in what seems to be a random
fashion, but there is still ample space for the barmaids to walk through to
set out food and drinks.  A large fireplace dominates the south wall, the
hearth is swept and ready for a warm fire during the winter.  A small
staircase leads upwards in the south-west corner of the room, to the
comfortable beds waiting for a weary customer to rest upon.  East are the
swinging doors leading to the kitchen, and north lies the entrance to the
inn.

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is

and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of

The Cartographer
  From wall to wall, bins are filled with rolled-up pieces of parchment
making up a collection of drawings of the world, a few times over.  On a
desk, near the back of the room, an inkpot, several quills, and lots of
unfinished maps rest atop a workdesk.  A letter is on top of the counter
addressed to the Wanderers of Avendar, that is likely how this Cartographer
gets his information, however, the price is probably not a cheap one. 
Commerce Street lies to the east.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

A Ferry Station
  The waters of the Dantaron River flow placidly to the north, a muddy
brown barrier to merchants, carts, and foot travelers.  A small wooden dock
has been erected at the water's edge, and several large ferries run by
riverfolk carry passengers back and forth between the Arien Road and the
outskirts of Var Bandor.

A child of Var Bandor runs along playfully, giggling and laughing.
The ferryman stands along the river, offering to transport travelers.

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

Northwest of Tyril Square
  The northwest corner of Tyril Square is formed by the intersection of
Earendam's massive north wall and a squat brownstone building to the west. 
Covered with a cobblestone of glazed brown bricks, the square stretches off
south and east, heading toward the north gates of town to the east, and a
central fountain to the southeast.  The occasional armed patrol lingers
around an arched portcullis to the west, usually coming from or going to the
north gates of the town.  Further south the square opens to the west,
following Frinian Way.

Frinian Way
  Frinian Way is a broad but winding street which bends west and south as
it makes its way through New Earendam.  Scholars, artisans and other
craftsmen use this street, bringing their goods from the east part of the
city to service the mercantile activity in the Arien Plaza.  The street runs
flush with the northern wall of Earendam, which towers well over 
twelve feet in height.  Made from bricks shaped by earth scholars, the wall
is well maintained, and almost clashes with the much older and more scuffed
cobblestones of Frinian.  To the east of here, a gated archway leads toward
the headquarters of the Company of the Jackal, one of the groups of
chartered templars which patrol the area north of Earendam proper.

Plaza, where they can be peddled to the merchants that gather there further
west.  The buildings lining this street appear of more recent construction
than the cobblestones of Frinian, which show the marks of what could only be
nigh on hundreds of years of wear.  In contrast, the surrounding buildings,
while hewn from the Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  In
particular, a small tower and base lies to the northwest of here, seemingly
formed from the melting of some liquid black stone.  Home to the enigmatic
Brotherhood of the Golden Flame, the tower seems active, but no entrance is
apparent from this vantage point.

Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  Most dramatic is a small
tower and base, which lies to both the north and west.  The entire buildings
appears to have been formed from the melting of some liquid black stone, the
tower is also known to be home to the enigmatic Brotherhood of the Golden
Flame.  A small trickle of traffic comes to and from the base of the tower,
which can be accessed via an opening in the stone to the west.

A Bend in Frinian Way
  Frinian Way is a broad but winding street which bends north and west as
it makes its way through New Earendam.  Scholars, artisans, and other
craftsmen use this street, bringing their goods from the east to the Arien
Plaza, where they can be peddled to the merchants that gather there further
west.  The buildings lining this street appear of more recent construction
than the cobblestones of Frinian, which show the marks of what could only be
nigh on hundreds of years of wear.  In contrast, the surrounding buildings,
while hewn from the Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  In
particular, a small tower and base lies to the northwest of here, seemingly
formed from the melting of some liquid black stone.  Home to the enigmatic
Brotherhood of the Golden Flame, the tower seems active, but no entrance is
apparent from this vantage point.

The Eastern Arien Plaza
  The Arien plaza comes to an end here, narrowing to Frinian Way, which
winds eastward into the part of the city known as New Earendam.  The
merchants who mill about the other parts of the plaza thin here, and the
travelers heading east here tend to be artisans or scholars of one form or
the other.  Shops line the sides of the plaza further north and south, and a
fountain dominates the center of the plaza to the west.

the Arien.

here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the

face, and thin tufts of hair curl out from above his copper-brown eyes. 
Cherrywood-colored flesh, its ridges shallow by the standards of his people,
is marked by a small knot on his left forearm, and the ridges on the back of
his right hand seem to have been smoothed from repeated rubbing.  From the

The Bar of the Arien Way
  Located on the western side of the common room of the Arien Way, this bar
runs north and south along the west wall.  Made of sturdy oak, the bar
stands waist-high, lined by the occasional low backed wooden chair.  Behind
the bar are barrels of ale and mead, with the occasional bottle of wine in a
rack on the wall.  Servicing mainly the merchants and their entourages, the
bar seems lacking in the more exotic drinks, despite the relative fineries
of the decor.  The common room continues to the east, while the bar ends to
the south.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues in
all directions save west, where the bar lines the west wall.

Anteroom of the Arien Way
  This small hallway serves as the anteroom for the Arien Way, a popular
tavern in this part of Earendam.  Covered in panelled pine, the walls of the
hallway narrow in a doorway to the north, leading to the interior of the
tavern.  Covering the floor of the anteroom is a tiled mosaic, depicting the
traditional sign of a tavern, made using colored stones from the Brintors.

  The northwestern corner of the Arien Plaza bustles with activity as it
approaches the city walls of Earendam to the west.  Travelers and merchants
wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of
Earendam to the south.  The edge of the plaza lines a row of shops to the
east, but comes to an end here, where a large inn sits in the crook between
the city wall and the shops to the east, and is marked by the sign of a
flagon and bedroll.

The Western Arien Plaza
  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The West Gate of Earendam
  Earendam's west gates are made of sturdy iron, built between two tall
stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Bull'

The first offensive form that a swordmaster learns, the form of the bull
provides a substantial bonus to all damage they deal with a sword. However,
they will far more frequently miss due to armour class, unless they are
intimately familiar with their weapon.

doors reinforced with iron bars, the gates are maintained rigorously.  The
walls to the north and south are solid stone, with murder slits.  East of
the gates, the docks of Var Bandor bustle with activity as merchant barges
are loaded and unloaded.

  The eastern gatehouse of Var Bandor opens before you, the towering walls
of the city rising to the north and south.  A close watch is being kept on
the travelers entering and leaving the city, and a roster of those banned
from the area is kept nearby.  To the west, Aragol Street runs to the heart
of Var Bandor, and to the east is the docks area.

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Serpent'

The form of the serpent allows a swordmaster to move with the sinuous
swiftness of the serpent, significantly increasing their chance to dodge
attacks, as well as kicks; furthermore, they will never miss an attack due to
the opponent's armour class. However, the heightened precision will cause a
reduction in all outgoing melee damage.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the south is the central square of
Var Bandor.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  The Aragol river runs swiftly over shallow rocks and small, dark pools. 
To the west, up against the banks of the river, there are trees and brush. 
It is dark between the trees, and a shadow of a cloud moves across the
leaves.  Vast plains stretch out on the opposite side of the river, and far
away, far beyond the plains, rise mountains in the sun.  Northwards, the
river passes the jutting, wooden docks of Var Bandor.

  A few amphibious trees grow from the ground here, their mud-caked roots
holding the trunk of the tree high above the level of the ground.  They have
grown rather towering due to lack of competition for sun and nutrients and
thus nearly obscure the sky from view, their thick, flat leaves rustling
gently in the breeze.  A few animals have made their homes within the thick
roots of the tree.  Without a view to the sun, the ground below is
perpetually damp and is covered with a carpet-like layer of grass.  The
ground becomes less grassy and becomes muddy and damp to the south and east,
while it becomes a mix of sand and dirt to the west.

A Deviant Path
  Breaking out of the plantlife around it suddenly, this small path heads
to the east and south.  Walls of plants rise around you, standing nearly
eight feet tall in places.  The reeds rustle faintly at every interruption,
often swaying and turning with the wind.  A small path is barely visible
through the reeds to the west, yet the only way northward is entirely
blocked.

Near a Dilapidated Hut

Its walls bow out at the bottom, and the wood of the building is stained,
cracking, and mouldering all over.  The area around here looks as if it was
once part of the village but has been overrun with plants for many years.  A
number of reptilian footprints pock the mud, giving it an uneven appearance.
The doorless frame to the east leads into the hut, and a particularly dense
wall of reeds blocks passage to the north.

A Dilapidated Hut
  The walls of this hut are almost entirely rotted through, bowing out near
the bottom.  A narrow window opens to the north, through which a number of
reeds have poked their tassled heads.  Little light filters into the room,
save from the doorframe to the west and a rather large hole in the northeast
corner of the roof.  Water drips from the hole in the roof, keeping the
uneven ground perpetually damp.  Reptilian footprints cover the mud in
small, water-filled craters, and a few body-shaped divots are sunk deep in
the mud in the northwest corner.  A boarded up door blocks passage to the
east.

An Overgrown Path
  The air here is thick and damp, giving a nearly tangible aura of humidity
to the locale.  The dirt here is tightly packed, much like that of the
village to the southwest.  What marks the difference between here and there,
however, is the abundance of tall plants that rise about you.  A few small
paths have been made through the plants, winding toward the north, west, and
south.  Two perilously molded buildings loom eastward, leaving only a small
space to pass between them.

A few thin trails that are lined with reptilian footprints have been made
here, winding around some of the larger plants.  A path that appears to be a
convergence of these small trails winds away toward the north and west,

chipped whitewash of the hut which lies beyond.  A glassless window peeps
through the grass on the hut's wall, about at the height of a human's head.

merchants, travelers, dockhands, and various other people.  The walls of the
city itself rise beyond the dock area, grand stone edifices designed to
protect the inhabitants of Var Bandor.  The river Aragol flows northward to
a junction.  Here, the pilings of the docks drive deep into the muddy bottom
of the water which swirls sluggishly along.  Large cleats are wound with
thick ropes for mooring, and filthy canvas fenders hang off the edges of the
docks.

help story
In the beginning, were the gods. Some to create,
some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring
hope, others to simply be. The gods, though, were
alone in the universe. Seeking a canvas for their
essence, they created the world of Avendar.
And, edged along ever so carefully by the gods
of creation, they created the alatharya,
FirstChildren of the gods. 

To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest
gift - Magic. Magic to create, magic to destroy,
magic, some portion of each of the gods'
essences was sent to swirl through the prime
material, creating the ether from which mages
drew. 

As time passed, the alatharya waxed mighty. The
gods, pleased, began plans for other creations,
each mighty in their own way. But the Alatharya
were not content with the god's plans to make
others - jealous of the thought that other
children might bring the god's attention away
from them, and coveting the Quintessence, they
sought to steal the power of the gods. With their
mighty pyramids, and strange rites, their priests
and scholars came together one fateful night for
a grand theft. In their hubris, they sought to
steal the power of the gods for themselves, and
make of themselves Creators. 

But, alas, it was not to be. The gods knew of the
theft, and instead of invoking the power of the
gods, they invoked their deepest and darkest
wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the
alatharya were rent in blood and fire - their
libraries burned, their pyramids turned to
rubble, their homes driven to the four winds. The
revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the
revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can
level entire worlds. So it was that the Alatharya
were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of
races. No more would the minds of the Alatharya
follow the intricacies of magic - nor would the
Alatharya do naught than strive for balance in
their day to day life, fearful of retribution for
their ancient crime. And, lastly, the gods
sundered Magic from its pure form into its
elemental components. Water, Spirit, Wind, Fire,
Void, and Earth did it break them, and forever
shatter the mortal dream of attaining the divine
through mystic arts. 

This sundering of the Magic released cataclysmic
storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, which
changed and altered all that they touched. Of the
god's new children, vast changes were wrought,
some for good, some for ill. The aelin were
granted flight, and the gift of keen reason. The
caldarans learned wisdom, and were turned from
the night. At the same time, the brutal srryn
were born, spawn of languid swamp and foul
hearts. Beneath the earth fled the shuddeni,
blind minions of pure darkness, driven mad, some
say, by a love of much knowledge. 

The centuries after the Sundering of Magic were
dark ones. It was not until some hundreds of
years that civilization began anew, with the proud
aelin and their cities in the skies. Striving,
perhaps, for a memory of things past, they
collected the artifacts of the ancient alatharya,
and built cities that at least faintly echoed the
glories of ancient days. 

And so it was the aelin waxed powerful, the
srryn confined to their torpid swamps and the
shuddeni to their caves, and all others brought
into alliance with them. For a time, it appeared the
world would never again know such a destruction,
until, at last, the gods allowed a new race to
awaken on Avendar - the humans. 

The humans were taken by any and all things,
some easily swayed to evil, others relentless
paragons of virtue. Some claimed them akin to
gods, others to devil-spawn of the Void, others
still to reckless children. Nevertheless, the
passion that drove the humans lead them, at first,
into a reckless alliance with the brutal srryn. 

In their midnight rituals, the srryn had learned
much of the ways of fire. Fire to burn, fire to
make their will be done - fire, to destroy. The
humans, always more keen of wit, seized the
secrets of the srryn fire shamans, cultivated
among their numbers the first Scholars of Fire.
Savage men, of an unholy taste for pleasure and
power, unleashed their magics across the surface
of Avendar. 

Securing the yoke about their fellow men, the
great Scholars of Fire also trained warlords, or
templars of fire, to command in battle with the
sword, and yet still reign destruction with the
forces of fire. Most of the races scattered
before the hordes of humans and srryn that
plundered all they found, but the aelin stood to
defend their cities, and forged an alliance to
fight to keep the humans at bay, lest the night
consume all. 

Cities were reduced to ash. Aelin died in droves,
using their already small collection of ancient
artifacts to drive the humans back. And yet, again
and again the humans surged forward. Quick to
breed, quick to die, the humans stood at the
verge of a destruction that would consume all. 

Fortunately, not all among the humans thought as
the Scholars of Fire. Small in number, but
present, were humans who sought meaning in
more than brute destruction. Groping blindly,
they sought to bring peace, to heal, to purify.
They craved a life spent in other activity than
blind devotion to an orgy of chaos and
destruction. 

Praying to the gods, they were answered. Jolinn,
Father of the Seas, Lord of the Sapphire Spear,
sent these brave few to seek the titans, who
dwelt high in the mountains, where they had
slumbered since the Sundering. Waking, they
taught the humans of the magics of Water, and of
the strength of the Seas. These humans
returned, and became the first of the Scholars
of Water. Born to bring healing to a troubled
land, their love of life quenched the inferno of the
fire mage's hate. With their aid, the aelin drove
the armies of Fire back to the swamps, where
most of the Scholars of Fire were put to the
sword. 

Thus ended what the chronicles tell of as the War
of Fire, when men nearly brought ruin once more
to the world. 

And yet, the aelin were not the ones to come to
dominance after the war. The humans, their
passion driving them still, slowly grew in numbers
across the surface of Avendar, while the aelin
remained in their cities, lost in the intricacies of
their own life. 

Those humans not already devoted to healing
learned much of the ways of earth from the god
Iandir, who brought law once more to the hills and
valleys of Avendar. Men paused in their mad
growth, and built cities, homes, places of staying,
order, and protection. 

And thus, many thousands of years passed.
Quarrels came and went, but none so great as a
war to drench and entire world in Fire. And so it
was that the empire of the Humans subsumed the
entire world. And yet, the humans were drawn to
more than just the surface, and began their
explorations of the nether regions of Avendar.
There, they found the great cities of the
shuddeni, a race blinded by the night, but who
still saw much, and gloried in the horror of the
demon sultans who taught them. 

Here, human scholars went who wished to learn
more. Tortured they were by the shuddeni, but
some, a few, learned their ways. Combining the
ritual of the shuddeni with the ancient learning of
the humans, the discipline of the Void was born. 

Who can say why the gods suffer such things to
exist? Certainly, the gods of the dark revel in the
Void, the Things which inhabit it not always of
their own creation, but often after their own
heart. Certainly, what the Scholars of the Void
did was the antithesis of life, and everything
living, but the gods of light could not bring and
end to them without disturbing the balance of the
world. 

So it was, those humans who studied with the
Shuddeni waxed mighty in their counsels, and
taught the shuddeni much of the ways of war. The
shuddeni culture, grown stagnant in their
millennia under stone, was re-energized by the
promise of conquest above the surface. On the
blackest night, of the darkest day of the year,
the humans and their shuddeni allies rode forth
from the caves of their dank abyss, to usher in an
age of Night the world had never known. 

Striking with meaning, order, and purpose rather
than out of blind rage, the forces of the Void
took cities, rather than burning them, and
corrupted them to their will. Mothers were
forced to offer their children as appeasement in
unholy rites, designed to serve the Things which
dwell beyond, some were kept as slaves, but the
cities under the sway of the Void lived, even if
they were more the corpses of cities than
anything resembling a living organism. 

The templars of water mounted counter-assault
after counter-assault. Some times, with success,
other times, with failures. For long 
years, the two sides held sway in a series of
enormous battles. With time, thought, the
Scholars of Water found their magic growing
weaker - the Things of the void had grown strong
on the flesh of the young, and pressed for more
mortal flesh. When all seem darkest, when even
great Earandam thought to send its children to
the aelin amidst the mountain, the unthinkable
happened in the ranks of the Void. 

Their dark rites prepared, their rituals chanted,
they brought forth not demons or other Things,
they brought forth instead the ch'taren. The
ch'taren, whether exiles from the world of
dreams or even the fabled astral plane, had used
the magic of the void against itself, and had
travelled into the Prime Material by means of
their gateways. 

Bringing with them large numbers and the magics
of the Spirit, they routed the dreadlord templars
of the void to their holes in the ground, where
those that served Fire waited, and picked off the
weak among them. Humans learned of the
freedom of the Spirit, and everywhere, cast off
their chains, and drove the fiends of the Void
back once more into seclusion. 

And, thus ended the War of the Night, where
men learned that the candle of hope flickers even
in the blackest of times. 

The ch'taren settled among men, whose empire
lies shattered. The other races, long secluded by
humankind, came forth to a new Renaissance.
Some learned of the ways of the aelin, and
brought forth their own creation - the magic of
Air, which sought no rule, order, or code, merely
meaning in its own chaotic existence. 

Thus, all six of the great elemental magics were
brought to Avendar. Men, in time, sought to form
again their empire, but found the world too vast a
place - Ethron inhabitants of forest oaks, Dark
winged nefortu dangling in their dark places,
and even the alatharya of yore were returned in
diminished form. 

Still, for a time men formed a Republic on the
main continent of their home, but, in recent times,
these alliances were sundered by the raids of the
Kankoran barbarians and their allies. This has
resulted in the city states we see today -
Earandam the grand, Var Bandor, and even Ashta
Harrud, desert capitol of commerce. 

All races today find more meaning in finding their
own niche in the struggle for power, rather than a
great gasp at one empire. The Houses of Avendar
reflect this diversification of thought among the
people of Avendar. Likewise, the Scholars'
Towers, were even the mages of void and spirit
exist in an uneasy detente. 

Moreso than any time in history, the world is a
wide place, separated by long distances, with
opportunity awaiting around every street corner
in the great cities. A time, where, perhaps, the
future belongs to those who would take it, and
dare to tread the Siege Perilous - a time for
adventurers.....

Unimpressed by the phalanx-shields of fighters, swordmasters have mastered
the art of parrying with their secondary weapons. While slightly less
effective than parry, this skill allows a dual-wielding swordmaster to defend
with his offhand weapon; this skill is most effective against polearms, and
least against daggers and whips.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Reed'

In the form of the reed, the swordmaster focuses all of abilities on using
his weapon to beat back his opponents attack.  Bending like a reed in the
wind, his ability to both parry and offhand parry is doubled.  However, this
level of focus means that he is then unable to attempt second, third, or
fourth attacks, and will lower the amount of damage dealt by a meditative
strike.

regards, the swordmaster will still see a marked increase in his ability to
parry and offhand parry, and he will be unable to attempt to make a fourth
attack in a combat round.

Your characters hit points are a measure of your ability
to sustain physical injuries to your body. If your hit points
ever drop to 0, you become incapacitated and begin to
slowly bleed to death. If your hp drops below -10, your character
will die. (see help DEATH) As your level increases, so 
too will your hit points. How much your hit points increase
is a function of your character's constitution and class.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Your armor class, visible with the 'SCORE' command, tells you how
well-armored you are against the physical and magical dangers of the world. 
It is a combination of natural intelligence, the protection offered by worn
items, and magical enchantments or enhancements.  Your AC is also affected
by your body position--sleeping characters have worse AC.  

The lower (more negative) your AC number is, the more effective your armor
will be at reducing damage, as a percentage value, with increasing returns
for lower values.  Against lesser opponents it may help to avoid being hit
altogether.  On the other hand, having an AC higher than zero will increase
vulnerability to damage.

|          Saving Throws and Resistances                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Two of your primary defenses against magical attacks and effects lay in two
areas: saving throws, and resists.

Saving throws (or 'saves') represent your generic resistance to all types
of magic.  In general, whenever you are the target of a spell or other
magical malediction, your saves are factored in when determining whether
you resist the effects.  Much like armor class, negative saves are better.

Resists (and vulnerabilities, which are essentially negative resists) are
more focused in nature, and only help against a specified type of magic or
damage.  When determining whether you resist a spirit scholar's 'manabarbs'
spell, for example, both your saves and your 'mental' resistance are taken
into account.  Resists also subtract, as a percentage, from the amount of
damage you take from attacks of that type.

  Example A: a fireball is cast on you, doing 100 fire damage.
  Example B: a flaming sword hits you, doing 100 fire damage.
  Example C: a magic missile spell is cast at you, doing 100 "other" damage

Saves
Saves represent magical resistance in general, and are shown in SCORE. They 
apply to all damage types. However, they also only apply to spells. In the 
case of (most) damage spells, they halve the damage (there are notable 
exceptions, like disintegration). To use the examples from above:
  
Example A: if you save against the fireball, you take 50 fire damage instead 
           of 100
Example B: this is a magic damtype, but not actually a spell. You get no save 
           chance, and take the full 100 damage
Example C: if you save against the magic missile, you take 50 other damage
           instead of 100


Damage Reduction
Damage reduction isn't a specific stat, but rather a concept not explicitly 
shown in score. Generally speaking, it represents a percentage by which 
damage is reduced (a few things, like durability and fugue, reduce instead 
by subtraction, making them more useful against lower damages and less 
against higher damages). It can apply to all or almost all damage (like with
sanctuary), or just to certain types. So in the examples below, assume you 
have 20% fire damage reduction from firekin:

Example A: the 20% reduction means you take 80 fire damage instead of 100.
           If you also saved, you'd take 40 damage. However, the damage 
           reduction does not help you save.
Example B: as with (A), you'd take 80 fire damage. Since damage reduction 
           doesn't care whether the source is a spell or not, it applies 
           here, while saves still do not.
Example C: your damage reduction is against fire, so you still take the full 
           100 damage.
  
  
Resistance
Resistance is the cream of the crop, acting as a sort of combination of 
saves AND damage reduction. However, unlike normal saves, the saves implied 
by resistance ONLY affect the specified damtype. The number of saves equals 
the amount of resistance, so for example if you cast ward of frost and gain
25 resistance to fire, you've just given yourself an additional 25 saves 
when saving against fire type spells, as well as 25% damage reduction. 25 
saves is a lot, so you will save very often against fire. Note that this 
doesn't mean fire-sphere spells necessarily,  it means fire-type spells. To
be sure, most fire-sphere spells are also fire-type, but to draw an example
from another sphere: searing light is spirit-sphere, but of type light, while
spiritwrack is also of spirit-sphere, but of type holy.
  
Anyway, let's go back to our example, assuming you've put up that ward of 
frost and gotten 25 resistance to fire as a result:

Example A: the bonus 25 saves from the resistance means you will probably 
           save, bringing the 100 damage to 50. But the 25 damage 
           reduction from the spell drops it further to 37.5.
Example B: the saves aspect does not help you since you cannot save melee 
           strikes. The 25 damage reduction still helps, bringing the 100
           damage down to 75.
Example C: the damtypes don't match up (fire vs other), so the spell doesn't
           help you at all. The 100 damage stands at 100, unless your normal
           saves manage to halve it.

The SCORE command shows you a variety of helpful statistics. Moving in roughly
clockwise fashion around the readout:

Your primary attributes appear on the upper-left side in the form of current
value(true value); for example, "Wis: 18(17)" would mean that your natural
Wisdom score is 17, but modified to 18 by some ability or equipment.

To the right is a block that displays various vital statistics, including your
race, class, gender, age (including age category), and the number of hours you
have logged playing as this character. Just a little bit further below shows
your hit points, experience, experience to level, and exploration points.

Below that is a block detailing the number of practices, trains, cash on hand,
and general details about the amounts and weights of the totality of the items
you are carrying. It also displays your alignment.

Underneath that is a large box, detailing your birthday, encumbrance, creation
traits, and how hungry you are. Further below that box might appear your
entire affects list, if you have opted to show them in the score via the SHOW
command; this can get very cluttered, but the option is available.

Finally, just below your primary attributes is a box displaying your armour
class.

Particularly long-term players might prefer the OLDSCORE command, which
displays much the same information, in a more antique readout; this is not
recommended, but remains available for people who choose to use it.

The SCORE command shows you a variety of helpful statistics. Moving in roughly
clockwise fashion around the readout:

Your primary attributes appear on the upper-left side in the form of current
value(true value); for example, "Wis: 18(17)" would mean that your natural
Wisdom score is 17, but modified to 18 by some ability or equipment.

To the right is a block that displays various vital statistics, including your
race, class, gender, age (including age category), and the number of hours you
have logged playing as this character. Just a little bit further below shows
your hit points, experience, experience to level, and exploration points.

Below that is a block detailing the number of practices, trains, cash on hand,
and general details about the amounts and weights of the totality of the items
you are carrying. It also displays your alignment.

Underneath that is a large box, detailing your birthday, encumbrance, creation
traits, and how hungry you are. Further below that box might appear your
entire affects list, if you have opted to show them in the score via the SHOW
command; this can get very cluttered, but the option is available.

Finally, just below your primary attributes is a box displaying your armour
class.

Particularly long-term players might prefer the OLDSCORE command, which
displays much the same information, in a more antique readout; this is not
recommended, but remains available for people who choose to use it.

During your time in Avendar, your character will age.  This aging process is
correlated to the time your character has been in existence.  On average,
characters will live about six and a half months, real time.  As you age, you
will experience various benefits or penalties for your age.

Different races age at different rates, hence a caladaran will start their
character older than a human, and a ch'taren will start significantly younger
than a human.  Regardless, all characters start out in what humans would term
as a young adult, mentally, physically, and socially.  If you are unsure how
to play your character's age, simply refer to the term in the brackets beside
it (ie, Youthful, mature, etc) for guidance.

The various categories are:

Youthful    : All characters create at this age.
Mature      : +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity
Middle-Aged : +1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom
Senior      : -1 Strength, +1 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -1 Dexterity
Old         : -2 Strength, +1 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Dexterity,
              -1 Constitution, -3 resistance to bash damage.
Elderly     : -2 Strength, +1 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Dexterity,
              -1 Constitution, -6 resistance to bash damage (total).
Ancient     : -4 Strength, +1 Wisdom, -2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution,
              -9 resistance to bash damage (total).

Should one somehow become older than this, there may be further penalties.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

In order to attain the next level, you must do more than acquire the
requisite experience points. You must also obtain the requisite 
exploration points (ep for short).
  
A character acquires exploration points by visiting rooms. Ep are
only gained on the first visit to a room. Some rooms or areas are
more dangerous than others, and will give more ep when visited. 
In brief mode, rooms do not count as being visited. A total of
4500 EP is required in order to achieve level 51.

The 'EP' command toggles notification of exploration points on 
and off.

Your statistics (stats) determine the degree of your character's physical and
mental aptitudes.  Stats range from 3-25, and all characters will have -5 to
their lineage maximums at level 1, then gain 1 to all stats every 10 levels
until 50. Statistics can be temporarily improved by items or affects, and
bonuses to your stats will offset debuffs. The specific effects of each stat
are listed in their helpfiles; your stats have no impact on the effectiveness
of your skills, HP/MP/MV gain, etc, only what is listed.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Hawk'

Dancing through the opponents blows like a nimble hawk, a swordmaster in the
form of the hawk finds that their ability to protect himself increases: their
dexterity increases and they gains a bonus to his armour class proportional to
their level. In this form, there is also a chance that they will evade
attempts to trip them, legsweep them, cross, ensnare, or surprise attack them,
punishing those who try with a full round of attacks.

Activation lag  :  1.0 rounds
Activation cost :  5 mana
Maintenance cost:  5 mana per round


Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Monkey'

A less-extreme variant of the form of the reed, form of the monkey is also
used to enhance a swordmaster's defensive capability. Less pronounced in all
regards, the swordmaster will still see a marked increase in his ability to
parry and offhand parry, and he will be unable to attempt to make a fourth
attack in a combat round.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues in
all directions save east.

        Spiritvision

Void scholars can command a victim possessed by an unclean spirit to
perform certain actions, should the target's will prove weaker than
their demonic infiltration.  The target is manipulated through the
commands 'command', 'control', and 'spiritvision'.

Command: 'command show' or 'command' by itself will inform the Void
Scholar who the current focus of their orders is.  When given an
argument ('command <action>'), this command attempts to force the
victim to perform the desired action.  If the target does not save,
he or she will carry out the will of the void scholar.  Note that
each order hastens the eventual escape of the victim.

Examples:
>command show
You are currently controlling Raestral.

>command grin
Raestral does as you bid.
Raestral grins broadly.

Control: 'control show' or 'control' by itself will display to the
Void Scholar a list of people they have managed to possess with
unclean spirits, as well as which one they are currently commanding.
When given an argument ('control <Target PC>'), this command will
switch the focus of the Void Scholar's orders.

Examples:
You are currently controlling Raestral.
Your will has been forced upon the following:
Raestral
Jolinn
Iandir

>control Jolinn
You shift your control to Jolinn.

>command
You are currently controlling Jolinn.

Spiritvision: A Void Scholar who has managed to possess another
person with an unclean spirit can manipulate that spirit's senses
through the 'spiritvision' command.  This will grant the scholar a
brief glance at the world around the spirit.  Since the sense comes
from the spirit, rather than the victim, the victim need not be able
to see or even awake for the command to work. However, because the
spirit must extend a good portion of its being back to the scholar
to transmit the glimpse, use of this command will greatly hasten the
eventual escape of the victim.

Note that while the victim must be present for the initial
possession, he or she may be controlled through the use of these
three commands from anywhere in the Prime Material.

Note also that while there is much freedom to one's commands, OOC
abuse of this power will not be tolerated.  Attempts to make the
victim change their password or prompt, modify their description or
background, or other such abuses are against the rules.

northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza

into the distance to the east and west, curving south at this bend.  The
flat monotony of the Plains of Arien are the only view to the north and
south, the neatly laid stones of the road providing the only change.

  The flat Arien Plains stretch before you, gray, vast and unchanging. 
Small shrubs grow here and there, surrounded by patches of dry grass, but
for the most part the Plains are unvegetated.  To the south, the Arien Road

tower menacingly to the south, and north and south of the river ferry

  You stand outside the north wall of Var Bandor.  In the distance to the

on either side.  The ground here is muddy and level, with little grass
growing. Behind you to the south, the stone wall of the city overshadows

Bandor on either side.

  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

Syntax: Assume 'Form of the Mongoose'

Imitating the exotic mongoose, this notoriously stylish form allows a
swordmaster to strike successively in combat, for each blow he attempts to
land. These attacks may miss or be blocked as with any other.

The Tipsy Swordmaster
  The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the

An Empty House
  This house seems to have been lived in rather recently, but the tenants
have since moved on in their existences.  A few, ragged blankets still line
the northern wall, however, judging from the droppings left behind, they got
their most recent use from some sort of rodent.  You can exit the house to

  A thin layer of dust is visible throughout this building, which clearly
was once a leather shop of some sort.  Bare hooks line the walls, where once
merchandise must have hung.  An old counter sits near the back, emptied and
dusty.  A small sign tacked up to the wall indicates that the prior owner
was forced to close shop due to a family emergency, and that there is no
planned date of re-opening.  To the north, you can hear the sounds and

A Brightly-Lit Shop
  A fortune's worth of glass fronts this shop, its meticulous frosting
obscuring the dreary cobbles of Iron Street.  A fireplace set into the side
wall wards off the damp and fills the room with a fragrant pine scent;
enough to mute the acrid tinge from the tannery next door.  Thin stone
columns support the raised ceiling, making this building taller than those
around it.  Above, a massive and opulent golden chandelier lights the shop,
its smoke and those of the steel sconces about the room darkening the roof's
wooden beams.  At the back of the store is a low, wide counter, providing an
easy work surface for final clothing alterations.

  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop's north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting

  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A

Sald Street
  Sald Street is a narrow, winding avenue that closely resembles a
forgotten alley.  The broken cobblestones are damp with rainwater,
indicating a malfunctioning drainage system.  The houses in this
neighborhood are wretched, torn-apart things, filthy and barely habitable. 
Sald Street runs north and west, and dead-ends to the south.  To the east is
a broken house.

A Run-down House
  This house is still remotely homely: the owner seems to have done
whatever he could to make it inviting, but did not keep it up well.  A hole
is in one wall, letting the eastern light fall directly on the bed.  You
hear the faint squeaking of many rodents, and skittering claws in the walls.
However, a faded landscape of rolling hills is slowly disintegrating with
time, on the western wall.

  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

heavy, steaming apparatus.  Further in, an oven is kept warm and the bakery
shelves stocked.  A staircase leads up to a private apartment.

classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against

intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the

The dried cherries and raisins in the packet are fresh, and combine with the salt on the almonds for

The Western Arien Plaza
  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The Northwestern Arien Plaza
  The northwestern corner of the Arien Plaza bustles with activity as it
approaches the city walls of Earendam to the west.  Travelers and merchants
wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of
Earendam to the south.  The edge of the plaza lines a row of shops to the
east, but comes to an end here, where a large inn sits in the crook between
the city wall and the shops to the east, and is marked by the sign of a
flagon and bedroll.

Anteroom of the Arien Way
  This small hallway serves as the anteroom for the Arien Way, a popular
tavern in this part of Earendam.  Covered in panelled pine, the walls of the
hallway narrow in a doorway to the north, leading to the interior of the
tavern.  Covering the floor of the anteroom is a tiled mosaic, depicting the
traditional sign of a tavern, made using colored stones from the Brintors. 
The streets of Arien plaza are to the south.

a small anteroom to the south, and a stairwell leads north to the rooms above.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  An exit lies to a hallway to
the east, and the bar is further west of here.

Andralis is a rather handsome aelin, with features marking him as a
nobleman of one of Ilodaiya's houses.  Marked with harsh lines, his face
seems aged by the discipline of a soldier's life, but his eyes tell a
different tale.  With a merry smile, he occasionally greetings a passing
pattern, or runs his hand lovingly over the grain of the wooden table at
which he sits.

        factions

Avendar is home to a number of groups, orders, and factions.  Your
reputation with each of these groups is handled by a standing system, which
is often affected by the completion of quests and who or what you kill. 
When you kill NPCs of who are aligned with a faction, your standing with
them, their allies, and their enemies will change.  

Much of the time, your standing with a faction will be neutral, which incurs
no bonus or penalty.  When you are a friend of a faction, NPCs will respond
differently, and at times offer different reactions or services.  When you
are a faction's enemy, at best they will ignore you; at worst, they will
attack you on sight.  Most classes will automatically be considered a friend
of the guild of which they are a member.  

To find out your standing with a given faction, use the finquiry command
on an NPC aligned with it. To see all allied and enemy factions, use the
factions command.

<390hp 334m 222mv> The Bar of the Arien Way
  Located on the western side of the common room of the Arien Way, this bar
comes to an end here, continuing further north as it hugs the wall.  This
part of the tavern is rather smoke-filled, as it approaches the kitchens,
which lie past a wooden set of double doors to the west.  The common room
opens to the east of here.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues
north and east, and meets the bar west of here.

The Northwestern Arien Plaza
  The northwestern corner of the Arien Plaza bustles with activity as it
approaches the city walls of Earendam to the west.  Travelers and merchants
wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of
Earendam to the south.  The edge of the plaza lines a row of shops to the
east, but comes to an end here, where a large inn sits in the crook between
the city wall and the shops to the east, and is marked by the sign of a
flagon and bedroll.

The Western Arien Plaza
  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The West Gate of Earendam
  Earendam's west gates are made of sturdy iron, built between two tall
stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

A Path to a Hill
  To the north, the path veers sharply toward a cluster of low foothills. 
An opening in the face of the nearest hill leads into a cavern, and to the
south, the lower foothills spread vastly.  Far in the distance, the peaks of
the Brintor Mountains tower above the horizon, a grand spectacle in the
background.  

[Exits: north south]

<390hp 334m 205mv> 
The Mouth of the Cave
  A gap in the face of the hill opens into a large cave.  The walls are
slick with condensed moisture and growths of fungus.  There is a musty air
to the natural passage that leads north.  Many footprints mar the soft dirt
of the cave floor, packing it into a regular path in some areas.  

[Exits: north south]
A black cave bat clings to the wall.

A Damp Cave
  The damp cave continues, leading into the darkness to the north, and
toward the light of a cave mouth to the south.  The cave walls drip with
moisture, and subterranean fungi grow in colored patches.  The dirt of the
floor is packed by many footprints.  

[Exits: north south]
A red cave beetle flexes its mandibles threateningly.

The Mining Camp
  This stretch of cave is crowded with mining equipment, bedrolls for
several men, provisions, and various clutter.  Apparently this is the
temporary camp of a mining party.  Further evidence lies in a mine shaft
sunk into the west wall of the cave, and three mine carts partially filled
with ore.  The main cave continues north and south.

Background cleared.

<390hp 334m 222mv> 
bg + Adrajisk began an exhaustive study of discipline throughout Avendar's known
races.  This included the human disciples of Dolgrael, who were
well-established throughout the Republic; the aelin students of the sword;
and the fledgling art of assassinry, which shared its own curious
philosophical edge.  In this process, he was introduced to other artistic
forms which lent themselves to discipline, such as topiary and calligraphy. 
He then began the immense task of synthesizing these possibilities into a
greater whole.  

In time, he would demonstrate the techniques he had developed to others. 
Having passed beyond the primitive psionics of his forebears, he was able to
control his body on an unprecedented level.  He could rapidly heal wounds,
shatter a block of stone with a single strike, levitate objects, or walk
through fire without feeling pain.  These dramatic demonstrations affirmed
not only the primacy of Jalassa's philosophy of discipline, but as well
revealed a depth of potential which rivaled the greatest mages.  He named
this new school of study "ginta'cham'akan", "thought creating form", and
gained his first disciples within the Republic.  



Your background is:
Training in the deep underground caverns of Yithoul was intentionally
brutal.  Some of his fellow trainees related more with the Flame, showy and
direct in their methods.  Some more the void, scheming and controlling.  The
Masters kept extensive notes on the trainees.  Their project had been
established years ago.  A small section of cave set up in a village-esque
manner to house/train/observe the discarded shuddeni infants.  Continually
judging each as the young shuddeni attempted to live in such a situation
ensured only the properly molded would join the ranks of those sent to the
surface.  

Veljik found solace in silence.  He followed neither void nor flame which
was rare.  He seemed to have a talent for stealth but the thought of
sneaking brought an instant grimace to his scarred face.  He was direct, in
his core, but he witnessed how much harder it was for those who got noticed.


He brooded.  He watched, much as the Masters watched, and he waited.  

Somehow he ended up surviving the "camp" and was sent to join the ranks of
the those being sent to the surface.  Survive and prosper were his orders. 
You are the blood of Yithoul.

--------------------------------------------------------------------NEW BACKGROUND------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The quiet village had little in the way of ornamental decoration. The buildings seemed well-crafted 
but, seemed more than anything, built for a purpose. The circular pattern of the place
seemed to conceal the the place from itself. Attempting to wander from one building to another was 
an effort. A little over a dozen of the structures, total, veljik caught the eye of every
single one. His trek from Yithoul had been a long one and he anticipated this to be only the 
beginning.

As he moved through the walkways half sliding his feet the a simple truth dawned on him. In this 
place, the hidden blade is the most powerful. He understood why he was exiled from his race.
A soft rustle brings his hands around,  lesser ak'aginta unwavering, a low kick that seemed to 
materialize from the shadows. His eyeless gaze turned to sense an overwhelming amount of activity 
around him. Several punches from countless directions
pummeled him. As he struggled the unrelenting hands pushed him to unconciousness. 


"Why are you here?" the old caladaran asked.
"Ak'aginta." He replied, as he habitually adjusted his underwrapping. Such precautions had 
protected him from the Star since his wandering here. 
Keeping his head turned slightly in deference Veljik continued, "You have taught me much already."
"What do you believe of the circle?" the caladaran continued, fact stoic.

The two faces turned, mirroring each other in demeanor, a sharp contrast drawn in physical 
appearance.

"It is the end with the beginning. It is the beginning with the end. It is perfect."  Veljik rasped.
 

The Grandmaster rose smoothly. Veljik remained seated head deferred to  the wooden floor.
"Begin training, with the ginta'am'akan as well then, Veljik v'Edaris." the old caladaran left the 
room, a piece of paper left where he was once seated.

<390hp 334m 222mv> 
bg + Adrajisk began an exhaustive study of discipline throughout Avendar's known
races.  This included the human disciples of Dolgrael, who were
well-established throughout the Republic; the aelin students of the sword;
and the fledgling art of assassinry, which shared its own curious
philosophical edge.  In this process, he was introduced to other artistic
forms which lent themselves to discipline, such as topiary and calligraphy. 
He then began the immense task of synthesizing these possibilities into a
greater whole.  

In time, he would demonstrate the techniques he had developed to others. 
Having passed beyond the primitive psionics of his forebears, he was able to
control his body on an unprecedented level.  He could rapidly heal wounds,
shatter a block of stone with a single strike, levitate objects, or walk
through fire without feeling pain.  These dramatic demonstrations affirmed
not only the primacy of Jalassa's philosophy of discipline, but as well
revealed a depth of potential which rivaled the greatest mages.  He named
this new school of study "ginta'cham'akan", "thought creating form", and
gained his first disciples within the Republic.  



Your background is:
Training in the deep underground caverns of Yithoul was intentionally
brutal.  Some of his fellow trainees related more with the Flame, showy and
direct in their methods.  Some more the void, scheming and controlling.  The
Masters kept extensive notes on the trainees.  Their project had been
established years ago.  A small section of cave set up in a village-esque
manner to house/train/observe the discarded shuddeni infants.  Continually
judging each as the young shuddeni attempted to live in such a situation
ensured only the properly molded would join the ranks of those sent to the
surface.  

Veljik found solace in silence.  He followed neither void nor flame which
was rare.  He seemed to have a talent for stealth but the thought of
sneaking brought an instant grimace to his scarred face.  He was direct, in
his core, but he witnessed how much harder it was for those who got noticed.


He brooded.  He watched, much as the Masters watched, and he waited.  

Somehow he ended up surviving the "camp" and was sent to join the ranks of
the those being sent to the surface.  Survive and prosper were his orders. 
You are the blood of Yithoul.

The quiet village had little in the way of ornamental decoration. The buildings seemed well-crafted
but, seemed more than anything, built for a purpose. The circular pattern of the place seemed to 
conceal the the place from itself. Attempting to wander from one building to another was an effort. 
A little over a dozen of the structures, total, veljik caught the eye of every single one. His trek 
from Yithoul had been a long one and he anticipated this to be only the beginning.

As he moved through the walkways half sliding his feet the a simple truth dawned on him. In this
place, the hidden blade is the most powerful. He understood why he was exiled from his race.A soft 
rustle brings his hands around,  lesser ak'aginta unwavering, a low kick that seemed to materialize 
from the shadows. His eyeless gaze turned to sense an overwhelming amount of activity around him. 
Several punches from countless directions pummeled him. As he struggled the unrelenting hands pushed 
him to unconciousness

"Why are you here?" the old caladaran asked.

"Ak'aginta." He replied, as he habitually adjusted his underwrapping. Such precautions had protected
him from the Star since his wandering here. 
Keeping his head turned slightly in deference Veljik continued, "You have taught me much already."
"What do you believe of the circle?" the caladaran continued, fact stoic.
The two faces turned, mirroring each other in demeanor, a sharp contrast drawn in physical
appearance.
"It is the end with the beginning. It is the beginning with the end. It is perfect."  Veljik rasped.
The Grandmaster rose smoothly. Veljik remained seated head deferred to  the wooden floor.
"Begin training, with the ginta'am'akan as well then, Veljik v'Edaris." the old caladaran left the
room, a piece of paper left where he was once seated.

Your background is:
Student of swordmaster in yithoul - kungfu style - power of arkhural sect
style - strength achieved through different forms of restraint - long road
to restraint

evil nuetral so just not straight murdering all and looting all these street
walking hookers, right from the very beginning, is showing restraint, in his
mind

kungfu swordmaster trainer Master gets assassinated , as dying of poison
warns veljik's the unseen are the biggest threat , says learn to sense their
presence from motive alone , if you think they are there they are there type
shit , veljik goes to earendam and buys into swordmaster guild

bad ass caladaran kungfu master swordmaster that lounges at the looters
chalice - raider highlord and mercenary for the right price - aint got no
friends but is dedicated to making true friends - believes iron sharpens
iron ultimately and that the unrestrained power of evil actions are a thin
line of perspective

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against

intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort

  This wide foyer is sheathed in austere granite, with marble inlaid into
the floor in a simple geometric pattern, pleasing to the eye.  The ceiling
discards most elaborate vaulting common in the area, and has a plain,

stance is textbook- perfect, though he carries himself like a man more
heavy-set than his slender frame, typical of the Earendam nobility,
suggests.  A fervent dedicant of Iandir, Moreth has served as a legal
advisor on the Patrician's Council since rising to the head of his house,

Small, bladed weapons, daggers are one of the simplest melee weapons, often
favoured by scholars for this reason, most other professions in Avendar also
receiving training in them. Rogues are more intimately trained in their usage,
learning techniques both flashy and subtle. Typically thrusting or slashing
weapons, due to their length, they are poor at warding off blows though it is
likewise difficult to parry against a dagger. Someone wielding a dagger will
have a harder time getting around a shield, a stone phalanx, or a fighter's
fending.

dodging, fending, or using a stone phalanx, and unsuited against parrying of

One of the few skills taught by almost all guilds of Avendar, parrying is the
art of fending off an opponent's blows with one's own weapon. It is easiest to
do so with a staff, though polearms and spears are well-suited to it as well.
Swords and exotic weapons are neither good nor poor to one attempting to
parry, though gladiators will parry better with an exotic and swords parry
more effectively when wielded with both hands. Maces, axes, flails, daggers
and whips are in turn less and less suited to parrying with.

Fighters, by virtue of their training in a variety of techniques, will be more
skilled at parrying no matter what the weapon.

Wielding a weapon other than a sword or a spear in one's offhand will inhibit
parrying with the main hand, though gladiators learn techniques to parry
better while offhanding a whip. It is typically easier to parry when skilled
with one's own weapon.

It is particularly difficult to parry against daggers and whips, and easier to
parry polearms.

swords are simple to learn the basics of, but may take decades to master. The

A long shaft with a sharpened tip, spears are typically piercing weapons.
They can be found both as slender javelins requiring a single hand to use, or
thicker-shafted and needing both hands. One-handed spears are typically the
ideal choice for people trained in the usage of shields, as spears are a
superior weapon in a defensive capacity. Other professions skilled in dual
wielding often favour one-handed spears. Fewer guilds emphasize the usage of
two-handed spears, but they are still a relatively commonly used weapon.
Spears penetrate techniques such as fend and stone phalanx quite easily, but
are little use against watchers' deflection.

Dodge is a melee defense skill focused on the avoidance of blows. It is
particularly difficult to dodge flails and polearms, and easier to dodge
whips. Dodge is the favored defense of rogues, but it is taught in many other
schools as well.

All aelin receive a bonus to this skill.

The Common Room of the Arien Way
  The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room's decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues west
and north of here.

Andralis is a rather handsome aelin, with features marking him as a
nobleman of one of Ilodaiya's houses.  Marked with harsh lines, his face
seems aged by the discipline of a soldier's life, but his eyes tell a
different tale.  With a merry smile, he occasionally greetings a passing
pattern, or runs his hand lovingly over the grain of the wooden table at
which he sits.  
Andralis is in excellent condition.

Andralis is using:

  This small hallway serves as the anteroom for the Arien Way, a popular
tavern in this part of Earendam.  Covered in panelled pine, the walls of the
hallway narrow in a doorway to the north, leading to the interior of the
tavern.  Covering the floor of the anteroom is a tiled mosaic, depicting the

Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The Earendam Grasslands
  The lush green grasses of the Earendam Grasslands spread before you in
all directions.  The shoulder-high grass sways and whispers in the wind, its
motion giving the grasslands the appearance of a green ocean.  Now and then
the spoor of a plains deer is visible underfoot, but there are no game
trails or other landmarks.

The Earendam Road
  The Earendam Road is a narrow strip of stones, many broken or missing
from the passage of time.  The road was once heavily travelled by caravans
and merchants trading with the mountain outposts to the north, but in recent
years the road has fallen into disuse, and is no longer actively maintained.
The Earendam Road leads north and south through the grasslands.

Kalyius Way
  This paved cobblestone street connects the Kor Thrandian gates to the
fortified central tower.  Kalyius Way is surprisingly clean, likely due to
the mountain wind catching the dirt and debris from both caravans and the
boots of travelers.  Stone buildings with high, sloped roofs line the
street, their heavy wooden doors keeping out the cool, fickle breeze.  What
plants are visible are mostly squat shrubs that grow stubbornly in the rocky
soil.  A wooden sign names the northern building as the town armorer.  A
small tailor's shop is to the south.

An Entrance to the High Tower
  A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the east, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain wind
whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The path
continues north and south, while to the west, a paved road leads to the
town's shops and homes.  To the east, a large door leads into the keep

The Gallery of Heroes
  The ceiling for the base floor of the tower extends nearly twenty feet
into the air, supported by dark stone columns.  Orbs of smokeless orange
light, high above, are mounted upon the pillars, casting their light
throughout the floor.  Set into the nearby pillar is an oil painting of
General Kalyius, leader of the Army of the Golden Hand.  A golden plaque
beneath it describes his personal heroism.  The tile floor is well-swept,
and the air is still with reverence.  Heavy wooden doors lead both to the

  Large, wooden barricades line the southern path, ensuring that the
training areas for the Kor Thrandian soldiers and archers remain both
contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible

light the interior of the chamber.  Low platforms are placed throughout it,

light covers each, shielding the armor from the effects of time, or simple
thievery.  A silver plaque is affixed to the base of each platform,

A Path Through the Training Grounds
  A small footpath cuts through the trampled grass of the training grounds,
pounded into a slash of hard-packed dirt.  The shouts of battle and
instruction ring out from all directions, although the soldiers who follow
the path either have yet to begin, or already have completed, their daily
routine.  The thick scent of exertion is carried across the path by the
mountain wind, as well as the smell of the wild grass and the town to the
north.  The path continues east and west through the field, while the
training grounds wait to the north and south.

The Archery Fields
  The open fields of the archery range stretch out quite far, the high
peaks of the Brintors rising overhead in the distance.  The wild grass of
the mountains has been trampled down by the steady, repetitive visits of the
Kor Thrandian archers.  The wind here is awash with the sweet scents of
thinner air, although carrying with it a heady whiff of sweat.  Against the
far northern barricade, a variety of standing, humanoid targets are stuck
with arrows.  To the south is a path through the archery field, while the
field itself continues to the east.

The Archer Captain's Post
  On the far side of the archery range is a small post for the overseeing
captain.  The ground here slopes upward as it proceeds east, giving an
improved view of the northern and southern fields.  The grass here is longer
and less trodden than elsewhere on the field, springing up through the rocky
soil.  Several stocks of arrows and additional bows lay in a cleared area,
supplying the nearby archers with whatever they might need.  The air here is
especially sweet, rolling down off of the high, looming mountains.  To the
north and south are the archery fields, while a dirt path leads west.

l 2.
Raiali Iristi is one of Kor Thrandir's newest officers, and oversees the
archery range.  She is short and mischievous, with wild silver hair and
rich, golden skin.  A native of the keep, she traveled abroad to study
archery and magic with Earendam's Company of the Zephyr.  She returned with
the completion of her formal training, enlisting within the military during
the Eyeblight War.  Her exceptional skill with the bow allowed her to rise
quickly within the hierarchy of the Lord Protector's archers, becoming one
of the keep's few female captains.  
Captain Raiali is in excellent condition.

Captain Raiali is using:
<worn on torso> a forged iron breastplate
<wielded>       a sleek steel sword
<held>          a smooth white longbow
