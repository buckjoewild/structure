Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type

The Gleaming Blade
  Torches adorn both side walls and sit upright in their gilded holders. 
Their light flickers and causes the various bladed weapons to glint sharply.
Several studded maces, and various other weapons of destruction are lined
along the walls in weapon racks.  A spinning stone wheel, used for
sharpening blades, stands near the back of the shop with a bucket of water
next to it to help with the enormous amount of heat produced during the
process.  You can exit back to the west.
