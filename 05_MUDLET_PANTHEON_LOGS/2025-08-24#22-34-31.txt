The Northeast Corner of the First Floor
  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
south and west, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill
the quiet air.  To the north lies a stairwell leading to the second floor.

A Breezy Stairwell
  This stairwell is in the far northeast, just outside of the first floor
proper.  It is rugged and dark, lit with flickering torches.  However, as
the stairs climb higher, the chill cling of the air lessens and the basement
scent dims.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing
the flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and
smooth, suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the
rat-infested first floor of the Tower of Testing, while the second floor
awaits above.

A Breezy Stairwell
  This stairwell is on the far north side of the second floor of the Tower
of Testing.  It is rugged and dark, lit with flickering torches.  As the
stairs descend back to the first level, the air becomes colder and more
dank.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing the
flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and smooth,
suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the lizard habitat
on the second floor of the Tower of Testing, while the first floor lay
below.

The Beginning of the Second Floor
  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor is generally shaped
like a cross, with two long intersecting hallways.  The floor here is the
same rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This hallway continues south, while the
stairwell to the first floor lies to the north.

The Intersection on the Second Floor
  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor here is the same
rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This area serves as a point of
intersection between the two hallways of the floor, with one going east and
west, and the other going north and south.

A Glass Stairwell
  The second floor comes to an end with a stairwell leading upward.  The
tower here begins a transition away from the rough-hewn stone of the lower
levels toward white brick and tile, much like that of the School of Heroes. 
The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor below, with high glass
panels that follow the stairs as they proceed further up.  From here you
have a pleasant but commanding view of Avendar's distant horizons, with
vents letting in further fresh air from above.  The stairway is
significantly warmer than below.

Syntax: Automatic

Upstart's panache allows one to substitute style for skill: should one's
charisma be higher than their dexterity, charisma will be used instead for any
and all relevant calculations. Additionally, this skill provides a chance to
ignore effects that disable iterative attacks when cornering.

The East Side of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls save the uncharacteristic cleanliness
of the western one.  The hall continues north and south.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell leads upward to the fourth floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The white stones of the third level end at the entrance to this
stairwell, instead replaced by the iconic marble of the School's main level.
The tile floor looks less worn and of a higher sheen, and the stairwell
itself is polished to a high gloss.  Arched windows look out onto the world
at large, high enough to give the faint of heart a bit of pause.  The sounds
of battle ring out from the floor above.  The long hall of the third floor

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

The Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the central altar set in the far
north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  A pair of flaming braziers are
near the southern doorway, which burn red from the light of the smoking
coals.  The air is filled with the cloying smell of myrrh, which drifts
through the air from no apparent source.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the

ancient stone walls.

floor, while the hall continues to the north.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell leads upward to the fourth floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The white stones of the third level end at the entrance to this
stairwell, instead replaced by the iconic marble of the School's main level.
The tile floor looks less worn and of a higher sheen, and the stairwell
itself is polished to a high gloss.  Arched windows look out onto the world
at large, high enough to give the faint of heart a bit of pause.  The sounds
of battle ring out from the floor above.  The long hall of the third floor
lies to the north.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

walls of high marble.  The ceiling is vaulted and extravagant, the entire
expanse forming a wide open battle arena.  The tiles of the floor compose a
patterned relief of the iconic sigil of the School of Heroes.  The air is
cool but smells of exertion, blood, and spellcraft.  Lanterns hang from the
high ceiling, lighting the chamber at night, while natural light filters in
through arched windows during the day.  A stairwell leads down to the third
floor to the west, while the chamber continues north and east.

A Stone Stairwell
  A stone stairwell leads upward toward the fifth floor, just on the other
side of the large tiled arena of the fourth.  The arched windows and heavy
construction suggest that this is one of the oldest remaining parts of the
Tower of Testing, the stone worn smooth by a thousand years of young
adventurers.  The stairs are smooth and even, and worn in the center from
the crossing of many footsteps.  Torches light the stairwell, giving it the
same shadowy cast as some of the lowest floors of the School and Tower.  The
fifth floor awaits above, while the tests of battle are to the west.
