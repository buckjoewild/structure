| Avendar, like most MUDs, uses colored text to help highlight what is     |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| Human:     Gregarious and flexible, known as great empire-builders.      |
| Aelin:     Slight with feathered wings, known for their grace and pride. |
| Alatharya: Giants with silvery skin, the First People cannot use magic.  |
| Caladaran: Sagely, tree-like people famed for their monastic traditions. |
| Chaja:     Caprine and reclusive giants with wooly hair and small horns. |
| Ch'taren:  Curious and alien beings the golden hue of their auras.       |
| Ethron:    Small, amphibious plant-loving people with colourful skin.    |
| Nefortu:   Chiropteran people known for their cunning and alacrity.      |
| Shuddeni:  Eyeless subterranean marsupials connected to demonkind.       |
| Srryn:     Bipedal reptiles known for adaptability and territoriality.   |
|                                                                          |
| All lineages are physically humanoid but different species. Hybrids do   |
| not exist. All characters roll up at the age of mental and physical      |
| maturity for their lineage, which may vary between species.              |
|                                                                          |
| Each lineage will have different innate traits (such as flight or        |
| darkvision) and a different spread of maximum statistics. For more       |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
| The First People created by Jolinn, the alatharya were stripped of their |
| ability to use magic after attempting to harness and wield the power of  |
| the divine against them.  In modern times, they remain marginalized and  |
| scattered as a people, living either in small and often nomadic groups   |
| or in human cities, where they find opportunities that use their         |
| superior physicality.  They are giants with silvery skin, white hair,    |
| and sculpted muscular frames.  Their size and strength allows them to    |
| wield two-handed weapons in one hand.  They have keen eyesight, allowing |
| them to see much farther than most.  Alatharya are excluded from playing |
| all scholars, all templars, and druids.  For more information, read HELP |
| ALATHARYA.                                                               |

The Beginning
  The School of Heroes is hidden in a remote valley in the Yagash
Mountains, and the cold bite of high elevation swirls around you under a
perpetually overcast sky.  Gilded symbols of the gods Dolgrael, Lilune, and
Jolinn have been lovingly sculpted into massive doors of dark basalt that
lock fast behind you.  There is no way back; only forward.  

Whether due to triumph or tragedy, a drive to desperate heroism or sadistic
villainy, you have come to this remote place and secured your adventurer's
license from the School of Heroes.  You have completed your official
training and registration and stand now before the Tower of Testing, where
your final practical examinations await you.  

You may leave through the portals connected to different towns on the
continent of Avendar in the Tower of Testing ahead, but you are encouraged
to proceed with your practical examination, as it will impart many valuable
skills and items for your life ahead.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens

Inside the Gates
  Past the wrought iron gates is a wide corridor with walls cut from solid
granite blocks, lit by mounted white globes.  The entry corridor is
surprisingly simple for such a vast and well-known establishment, as it
bears no notable ornamentation.  The School's foyer awaits to the north,
opening up from the corridor's enclosure into a vast chamber.  To the south
lies the School's entrance.

  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly

drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables

The chaja were the first lineage to settle the Brintor mountains,
building many great towering stone spires in homage to their starry goddess,
Kyana.  In obeisance to her foresight, they retreated underground enmasse,
establishing isolated strongholds within the mountains.  Soon after their
exodus, the aelin would settle in their former homes, mistaking their
majestic spires for alatharyan ruins; they would be scoured to dust within
centuries by the War of Fire.  

Chaja are now a largely subterranean people within the Brintors, their
mastery of the druidic arts transforming their underground caverns into
sunlit, verdant spaces.  The influences of the gods Elanthe and Kurion
alongside Kyana have made them a stoic people .  Owing to their isolation,
chaja are known outside the mountains for their frequent use as slaves by
the shuddeni, particularly during the War of Night when they were forced to
be shock troops.  The shuddeni continue to predate upon the chaja,
[Hit Return to continue]

kidnapping them for enslavement as laborers, hunters, or servants.  Crude
stereotypes and lingering prejudice have made chaja lives in outside cities
such as Earendam or Ashta Harrud frustrating ones.  They can frequently be
found commiserating with alatharya, who experience similar prejudices.  

Ranging between six and eight feet tall, chaja are quite stout and vaguely
caprine in appearance, with flat noses and small blunt horns often hidden in
their thick, wooly hair ranging in colour from cream to brown to black. 
They are quite hirsute, often growing mantles of long shaggy hair across
their shoulders, chest, and back, and both sexes may grow beards.  Young
chaja have much lighter hair and skin that darkens with age, and their eyes
are either colourless or very pale, without a visible pupil or sclera.  The
lingering blessing of Kyana allows chaja to see perfectly in darkness, and
they can eat almost anything without ill effect.  Their stature allows them
to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.

The alatharya were the First People: the first lineage created and
endowed by Jolinn with true free will.  During the eons of their dominance,
they colonized the whole of Avendar, creating many wondrous cities and
artefacts of incredible and now-impossible power, many of which endure and
are greatly coveted to the modern day.  According to the most commonly known
legends, the alatharya in their hubris attempted to challenge the supremacy
of the Overgods.  The First People were cast down by the heavens, and the
ensuing cataclysm-- known as the Sundering-- radically changed the face of
the land and destroyed the legendary power of the alatharya forever.  

The alatharya were stripped of their peerless magical capabilities, forever
rendered magically and resonantly inert.  With the loss of their magic and
the utter destruction of their civilization, the alatharya only survived the
Sundering and the harsh, frozen centuries that followed due to the
intervention of Enirra.  They adapted well to the wilds with the aid of the
[Hit Return to continue]

ethron, and together established the earliest arts of the Ranger and
Barbarian.  

Physically, the alatharya are enormous humanoids with silvery skin of
varying shades and pure white hair, which they frequently dye.  A typical
alatharya averages nine feet tall, with a broad chest and heavily muscled
limbs with very little body fat.  Their sheer size gives them some
resistance to physical blows and allows them to heft some two-handed weapons
in a single hand.  Their eyesight is incredibly keen, allowing them to see
and aim a weapon farther than most others.

Swordmasters are warriors who have devoted their lives to mastering one weapon
- the blade.  Learned in ancient meditative techniques, they practice the art
of ak'anginta: "thought-to-form", in which the sword becomes an extension of
self, with each style an expression.  Using these "ginta" or "forms", a
swordmaster becomes one of Avendar's most formidable combatants, displaying a
mastery of his weapon unparalleled by any other.  The roots of ak'anginta are
often claimed by the aelin, its graceful and aesthetically pleasing motions
expressing the highest ideals of their storied culture.  However, over time,
other races have left their mark on the profession's practice, be it in the
cruel precision of the shuddeni or the brutal power of the srryn.

Individual swordmasters often find personal affinity to a single form early
in training.  However, swordplay is as flexible as it is unique, leading many
to take great pride in mastering a variety of styles.  Additionally, the
trained ambidexterity offered by this path allows for greater diversity in
sword selection than other warriors.  Because of their dedication to a single
sword, longer-lived and more broadly experienced swordmasters are able to
vastly outclass swordsmen of other professions.
[Hit Return to continue]


A deeply aesthetic art, aelin swordmasters of good alignment often favor
Aeolis as a deity, while evil practitioners occasionally offer secret homage
to Serachel.  These affinities can also apply to other races as well,
especially those whose study heightens their appreciation for aelin culture.
However, the path of the ginta is often as deeply individual as its students,
making common swordmasters of all faiths, or none.

Trained for the arena-fighting that is common throughout Avendar, gladiators
transform the gruesome structure into a spectacle of showmanship.  Arising
from the slave culture of Ashta Harrud, gladiatorial combat grew in popularity
as word spread along northern trade routes.  With the emergence of the
shuddeni into the racial mix of Avendar, gladiatorial bouts have become both
more humane and less.  Cities such as Earendam the Grand have outlawed the use
of slaves and brought a measure of self-determination to the practice.
Meanwhile, its brutality has simultaneously increased with the growing number
of chaja and introduction of overworlders into the high-risk arenas of
Yithoul.

It is common for srryn to come north from their native swamps to ply their
bloodthirst in Earendam, the potential rewards outweighing the indignities of
competing against (and for the entertainment of) warmbloods.  Harrudim
gladiators are nearly exclusively human, whereas the shuddeni favor making
their chaja subordinates fight for pleasure.  The massive size of the
alatharya frequently make them a fan-favorite, their racial proclivity for
both resilience and force giving them notable advantages.  Kankoran often
[Hit Return to continue]

train as gladiators, although the radical fringe of pack society may shun them
for embracing this product of highly civilized life.

Dolgrael is a favored deity among gladiators, as their lifestyle puts them
frequently against the odds in battle.  The arena calls to no one faith or
alignment, and gladiators often pray to whatever god they feel most likely to
grant them victory.  However, such prayers are a privilege paid for in blood.

Gladiators are trained in a variety of weapons, as well as techniques to put
them to good use-- a lesson hard-learned from the restrictions of the arena.
The spear, the sword, the whip, and the flail are often weapons of choice for
a skilled gladiator, as each carries unique, tactical advantages.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the east, Dretch street leads into
the most notorious neighborhoods of Var Bandor.

Inside the Northern Gatehouse
  This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

A soldier of the Var Bandor Guard watches the gatehouse.

A Ferry Station
  The waters of the Dantaron River flow placidly to the north, a muddy
brown barrier to merchants, carts, and foot travelers.  A small wooden dock
has been erected at the water's edge, and several large ferries run by
riverfolk carry passengers back and forth between the Arien Road and the
outskirts of Var Bandor.

The West Gate of Earendam
  Earendam's west gates are made of sturdy iron, built between two tall
stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the
Arien Plaza opens, marking the beginning of Earendam proper.

The Western Arien Plaza
  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

  The northwestern corner of the Arien Plaza bustles with activity as it

wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of
Earendam to the south.  The edge of the plaza lines a row of shops to the
east, but comes to an end here, where a large inn sits in the crook between
the city wall and the shops to the east, and is marked by the sign of a
flagon and bedroll.

  This small hallway serves as the anteroom for the Arien Way, a popular

hallway narrow in a doorway to the north, leading to the interior of the
tavern.  Covering the floor of the anteroom is a tiled mosaic, depicting the

A tall, rough-skinned caladaran woman, Amaadri is styled the Heirophant
of the Pines.  She tends the growth of the North Forest, preserving it
against the careless incursions of travelers, merchants, and bandits that so
regularly tromp through the woods.  Her foliage extends in a loose green
fall of needles, twisting in long spirals.  Despite her own duties taking
her throughout the forest, she rarely strays too far from her beloved wife,
the Heirophant Chasisa.  
Amaadri is in excellent condition.

squared hall.  No markings are revealed on the shiny artificial surface, nor
any clue as to the purpose of the hidden cave.

along the far wall.  The keen eyes of bankers peer out from behind the
barred windows, scrutinizing their clientele.  Plants and small wooden
benches provide the decor for those waiting for service, and a doorway leads
southwards onto Commerce Street.

The Armorer
  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.
