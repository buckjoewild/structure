The Northwest Corner of the First Floor
  The Tower of Testing's first floor is a simple and rugged affair, built
of heavy, rough-hewn bricks.  Torches line the grey walls, and a chill
moisture clings to the air.  The floor underfoot is well-trod and packed
with rough mortar.  The first level of the Tower opens up into a low-lit,
open, and shadowy chamber.  There are no windows, and the dank air suggests
that this part is still below ground level.  The chamber continues to the
south and east, where the screeches of rats and the crackles of torches fill
the quiet air.

A Breezy Stairwell
  This stairwell is in the far northeast, just outside of the first floor
proper.  It is rugged and dark, lit with flickering torches.  However, as
the stairs climb higher, the chill cling of the air lessens and the basement
scent dims.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing
the flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and
smooth, suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the
rat-infested first floor of the Tower of Testing, while the second floor
awaits above.

A Breezy Stairwell
  This stairwell is on the far north side of the second floor of the Tower
of Testing.  It is rugged and dark, lit with flickering torches.  As the
stairs descend back to the first level, the air becomes colder and more
dank.  Warmer, fresher air travels downward on a faint breeze, causing the
flames to dance wildly atop their torches.  The steps are worn and smooth,
suggesting the passage of many feet.  To the south lies the lizard habitat
on the second floor of the Tower of Testing, while the first floor lay
below.

The Beginning of the Second Floor
  The second floor of the Tower of Testing is at ground level, with high
windows bringing in light from the outside.  The floor is generally shaped
like a cross, with two long intersecting hallways.  The floor here is the
same rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This hallway continues south, while the
stairwell to the first floor lies to the north.

rough-hewn stone as the level below, except it is now marked by lizard
droppings.  The scent of habitation is heavy in the air, but blissfully the
many windows offer a breeze and some freshening air.  The ceiling is fairly
high, and strung with oil lanterns.  This area serves as a point of
intersection between the two hallways of the floor, with one going east and
west, and the other going north and south.

A Glass Stairwell
  The second floor comes to an end with a stairwell leading upward.  The
tower here begins a transition away from the rough-hewn stone of the lower
levels toward white brick and tile, much like that of the School of Heroes. 
The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor below, with high glass
panels that follow the stairs as they proceed further up.  From here you
have a pleasant but commanding view of Avendar's distant horizons, with
vents letting in further fresh air from above.  The stairway is
significantly warmer than below.

hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never

The West Side of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  The hall continues to the north and south.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell leads upward to the fourth floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The white stones of the third level end at the entrance to this
stairwell, instead replaced by the iconic marble of the School's main level.
The tile floor looks less worn and of a higher sheen, and the stairwell
itself is polished to a high gloss.  Arched windows look out onto the world
at large, high enough to give the faint of heart a bit of pause.  The sounds
of battle ring out from the floor above.  The long hall of the third floor
lies to the north.

A Marble Stairwell
  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

liberation of Var Bandor, set before a wide, heavy desk.  The environment

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the

the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type

  The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first

of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

stone steps lead across the south of the room to an altar of deep brown
marble.  Carved above the altar is the lemniscate, traditional symbol of an
ancient order of priests devoted to the forces of balance in the universe. 
On either side of the altar stand twin statues, one made from carved ivory,

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

marble stairs lead up to enter some sort of scholar's shop, while the
building to the north is less ostentatious, being a simple stone block
guarded by gate archways.  Home to the Company of the Ram, the building
houses one of Earendam's chartered mercenary companies.

While some may feature ornamentation or spikes, maces are at their heart a
very simple weapon: a short length of metal or wood, typically used as a means
of blunt force. For this reason, they are often favoured by scholars and
templars of the earth, as well as barbarians, though several guilds train in
the usage of this weapon. Due to the length and balance of these weapons,
maces do not parry blows very well, and if offhanded will hurt one's main-hand
parrying. Maces will get around both shields and watchers' deflection
relatively easily.

  East Frinian Way heads in a straight east-west line through Earendam's
artisan's district.  Lining the street are shops bearing the products of the
craftsmen who work in this part of the city.  To the south is a jeweller's
shop, which is successful enough to have a plate glass window to display its
wares.  The armorer's shop to the north has no such trappings, but
nevertheless bears the symbols of its wares on a stout wooden sign.  Frinian
comes to an end to the east, but continues along its current path to the

marble stairs lead up to enter some sort of scholar's shop, while the
building to the north is less ostentatious, being a simple stone block

  The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar's most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan's quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

  The northeast corner of Tyril Square is formed by the intersection of
Earendam's massive north wall and a squat brownstone building to the east. 
Covered with a cobblestone of glazed brown bricks, the square stretches off
south and west, heading toward the north gates of town to the west, and a
central fountain to the southwest.  The occasional armed patrol lingers
around an arched portcullis to the east, usually coming from or going to the
north gates of the town.

North of Tyril Square
  The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir.

The North Gates of Earendam
  Earendam's north gates are forged from black iron, built between the
stone walls of the city.  Reinforced by stout iron bars, the gates are built
thick, for increased security.  Outside the gates lie the expanse of the
northern grasslands, across which runs the Earendam road, which leads all
the way to the Brintors.  Inside, Tyril Square marks the beginning of
Earendam proper.

The Earendam Road
  A narrow strip of stones that leads north into the grasslands, the
Earendam Road was once heavily travelled by caravans trading with the
mountain outposts to the north.  It has since fallen into disuse, but is
still nominally maintained by Earendam.

cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part

drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the

Syntax: Savagery 
  
Barbarian warriors are known for their ferocity in battle and ability to 
withstand physical blows. With the savagery skill, they are able to strike 
with much greater ferocity than before, and at the same time entirely shrug 
off some blows directed at them. They are more likely to shrug off attacks 
that would have dealt physical damage than magical, though it is still 
entirely possible to so disregard magical attacks.

The Journey's End
  The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

set out food and drinks.  A large fireplace dominates the south wall, the
hearth is swept and ready for a warm fire during the winter.  A small
staircase leads upwards in the south-west corner of the room, to the
comfortable beds waiting for a weary customer to rest upon.  East are the
swinging doors leading to the kitchen, and north lies the entrance to the
inn.

Barbarians are noted for being able to go on the warpath for an unfortunate

Ilrin Street
  A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

A Dingy Office
  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

A Run-Down Weaponry
  This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling
is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop's unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop's main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

The Saurian Armory
  This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop's north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop's unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room's only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air
of the city.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into

A Glass Stairwell
  The glass stairwell leads upward to the third floor of the Tower of
Testing.  The tower itself begins a transition away from the rough-hewn
stone of the lower levels toward white brick and tile, much like that of the
School of Heroes.  The ceilings are substantially higher than the floor
below, with high glass panels that follow the stairs as they proceed further
up.  From here you have a pleasant but commanding view of Avendar's distant
horizons, with vents letting in further fresh air from above.  The stairway
gets colder as it descends.  

A standing sign describes the trials of this floor.

The Beginning of the Third Floor
  The third floor of the Tower of Testing is a stone and tile affair, much
like the School of Heroes.  The bricks are white and lit by lanterns which
hang from the ceiling, as well as the large glass windows which look out
into the surrounding skyscape.  The tiles are dark and well-trod, showing
the scuffs of many young adventurers.  The air on this floor is surprisingly
clear and fresh due to better ventilation; however, it still stings the nose
with the acrid scent of summoning.  Scratches and the spattering of dark
blood mar the floor, ceiling and walls, with the high screech of imps never
far from the ear.  To the south, a glass-enclosed stairwell descends to the
second floor, while the current one continues to the north.

Activation lag  :  1.5 rounds

Syntax: Wildcraft <item>

Further enhancing their ability to live off the land, naturalists may craft a
variety of objects while in the wild. As they gain in level, weapons they
produce will be more powerful. Nets may be crafted in the woods, grasslands,
or swamps, while all the others may only be created in the woods.

Each individual class learns a different variety of tools; barbarians would
gain little from crafting arrows, and only druids know the means of crafting
totems, as an inexhaustive example. One may receive a list of craftable items
by typing 'wildcraft' without argument.

Hand-crafted arrows may be banded with varying colours. Hafts created by
druids may be shaped with the shape timber spell.

Skilled in fighting in large hordes, barbarians can indulge in a primitive 
bout of fury, straining their own bodies and minds to the limit as they strike 
out at all current opponents. For the duration of this skill, the barbarian 
will, in addition to his full complement of attacks against his current 
target, make a single attack each round against all others who do battle with 
him concurrently.

Syntax: Wildcraft <item>

Further enhancing their ability to live off the land, naturalists may craft a
variety of objects while in the wild. As they gain in level, weapons they
produce will be more powerful. Nets may be crafted in the woods, grasslands,
or swamps, while all the others may only be created in the woods.

Each individual class learns a different variety of tools; barbarians would
gain little from crafting arrows, and only druids know the means of crafting
totems, as an inexhaustive example. One may receive a list of craftable items
by typing 'wildcraft' without argument.

Hand-crafted arrows may be banded with varying colours. Hafts created by
druids may be shaped with the shape timber spell.

Barbarians are trained to wield their weapons with such strength and ferocity
that they are able to inflict damage beyond the ordinary enhanced damage.
While not as effective by itself as enhanced damage, because the two skills
work in conjunction, the overal effects are highly pronounced.

A barbarian may swing any weapon with tremendous force, dealing
incredibly high damage to an opponent.  While this skill always deals a

foes.

With this skill, a barbarian may cut themself for a miniscule amount of damage
and use the blood from the wound to draw an elaborate sigil upon themself.
This will help them to ward off magical effects, giving a bonus to saves.

Barbarians are so able to focus on their target that little will be able to 
impede them. With the ferocity skill, should the barbarian's opponent in 
battle be rescued or cower away from the front lines, the barbarian has a 
chance to remain focused on the at opponent, ignoring the rescuer or cower-ee. 
Even city guards or bouncers have a chance to fail to interpose themselves. 
However, this skill can do little against the dedicated attention of a fighter 
covering an ally.

  A marble stairwell ends at the doorstep of the fourth floor of the Tower
of Testing.  This entire floor is done in the polished black tile of the
School of Heroes proper, and the walls are a high, glossy marble.  The
chamber which composes the fourth floor is the largest and most open yet,
the great expanse of its floor composing a patterned relief of the School's
iconic sigil.  The air is cool but smelling of exertion, blood, and metal. 
Lanterns hang from the ceiling to illuminate the final steps before entering
the floor.  Down the stairs, the third floor awaits.  

A plaque is inset into the wall at the top of the stairs.

expanse forming a wide open battle arena.  The tiles of the floor compose a

cool but smells of exertion, blood, and spellcraft.  Lanterns hang from the

through arched windows during the day.  A stairwell leads down to the third
floor to the west, while the chamber continues north and east.

impede them. With the ferocity skill, should the barbarian's opponent in 
battle be rescued or cower away from the front lines, the barbarian has a 
chance to remain focused on the at opponent, ignoring the rescuer or cower-ee. 
Even city guards or bouncers have a chance to fail to interpose themselves. 
However, this skill can do little against the dedicated attention of a fighter 
covering an ally.

Syntax: Tan corpse <Belt/Mask/Vest/Gloves/Boots/Leggings/Collar/
        Sleeves/Bracer/Bag> <fitted (optional)>

Rangers and barbarians possess the ability to tan the hides from corpses they
find or create. These hides may be worn as armor, and improve in quality as
the maker gains in level. Depending on the abilities or race of the original
owner of the hide, the armor will have different qualities. In general, only
physical statistics can be improved by such armor, and it is always possible
to gain hit points. Tanned hides will deteriorate upon death, however, unless
the ranger makes them fitted. In this case, only the creator will be able to
wear it.

Known for their mighty blows, barbarians wielding two-handed weapon will be 
able to attempt an additional attack beyond what they ordinarily would be 
capable of. If the weapon is not naturally two-handed, this is subject to all 
the same benefits and penalties of wielding a weapon in this unintended 
manner.

Before the Gates of the School of Heroes
  Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Portal Chamber
  This cubical room is made from blocks of hewn marble.  Benches of similar
stone are set diagonally against the corners of the room, and an open
skylight provides illumination from above.  However, this room is unique in
that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly
beneath the skylight.  A more mundane doorway leads north, to the courtyard
before the entrance to the School proper.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing
  Just north of the Adventurer's Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber's only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

  The lower level of the School of Heroes serves as a gathering place for
young adventurers, as well as an entry point to the Hall of Trials and Tower

is a large, open expanse.  This corner of the lounge is a place for friends
to gather before entering the Tower of Testing, which trains young
adventurers in the ways of battle.  The dim echoes of its sounds filter back
into the lounge now and then, as a solemn reminder of how all students
eventually make their fortunes.  To the west and south, the lounge

exercises.

It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of

trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing

  A great octagonal room, this sumptuous parlor opens up to a fantastically

the interior of the steeple's high point, the bronze chains that dangle
beneath them glittering like tiny stars.  Against the south wall, a massive
and ornate divan dominates the room, its elaborate designs only heightening

  A small room fronts this establishment, a curtained-off door concealing
anything further in.  A creaky old desk fills entirely too much of the room,
covered in papers and carefully-stacked scrolls.  The walls are covered in
old handbills announcing bounties long since collected, gladiatorial bouts
from at least a year ago, and a few advertisments for local shops.  The
floor is kept cleaner than anything else in the place, and it too bears the

rolling hills slowly descending into the muddy shallows of Jasa Lake far to

feet of a simple statue.  A gurgling fountain pours into a pool about the

  A small beach is here, its thick brown sand almost entirely saturated

itself is low-lying, only barely venturing above the level of water within
the lake itself.  To the south, the beach slips beneath the waters into the
shallows.  Westward, the water of the lake gurgles softly as it flows into
the Aragol River.

The Shallows of Jasa Lake
  The water here is no more than a foot and a half deep.  The ground
beneath the water is clearly visible through the shimmering water, lined
with a layer of smoothed stones and pebbles.  A few cast off leaves float on
the surface of the water.  Amphibious reeds and marsh grasses grow from the
small beach that cradles the shallows to the north and east.  The body of
the lake expands outward to the west and south.

On Jasa Lake
  Flat and pristine, the clear waters of Jasa Lake stretch out before you. 
With a clear view to the sky, the air here becomes warm during the daytime
and provies an expansive scene of the stars by night.  Small disturbances in
the water's surface due to water insects and fish create quiet noises which
add to the serenity of this place.  The lake itself continues to the south
and west, while the waters become more shallow and easily fordable to the
east and north.

Near a Heavy Wood Pillar
  Rising stoically from the water, this huge wooden pillar supports a
platform of wood above your head.  Nearly as thick as a full-grown tree, the
wooden column shows very few signs of rot.  A high water mark is visible a
few feet above the current surface of the water, delineated only by a thin
white line.  A few aquatic plants cling to the pillar just below the water's
surface, gently swaying as waves lap against it.  The body of the lake lies
to the north, while a still pool lies to the east.  The platform continues
above you to the west, while a thick wood post similar to this is directly
to the south.

Near a Heavy Wood Pillar
  Rising stoically from the water, this huge wooden pillar supports a
platform of wood above your head.  Nearly as thick as a mature tree, the
column of wood shows very few signs of rot.  A high water mark is visible a
few feet above the current surface of the water, delineated only by a thin
white line.  A few aquatic plants cling to the pillar just below the water's
surface, gently swaying as waves lap against them.  A reedy bank is to the
east, leading to a small path.  The shoreline of the lake lies directly
southward, while a small pier extends into the lake to the west.  Northward,
a pillar similar to this one rises from the deeper waters.

At the Shore
  The shoreline here is mostly without sand.  A myriad tiny stones line the
edge of the gently lapping water, with each of their surfaces smoothed by
the water's continual movement.  A path follows the shoreline to the east,
leading away from the town to the south.  A heavy wooden pillar rises
stoically from the water to the north, appearing to support some sort of
wooden platform.  A small pier reaches into the water of the lake to the
west, covered from the sky by the above sheet of wood.

In a Fishing Village
  Looping around the side of a fishing hut, the mud and clay path here is
very well-defined against the wild grasses and reeds which grow further to
the east.  Bordered by the pebble-covered beach to the north, the small road
appears as if it was made by the earth itself rather than by the feet of
men.  A myriad tall grasses rise to the south, all but covering the deeply
chipped whitewash of the hut which lies beyond.  A glassless window peeps
through the grass on the hut's wall, about at the height of a human's head. 
The path continues westward toward the village, while it appears to sink
into the earth to the east.

In a Fishing Village
  Following the pebble-filled shoreline to the north, the ground here is
alternately covered with pebbles and firmly-packed dirt.  The passing of
hundreds of feet have worn both soil and mud to a smooth finish here, where
only a few errant weeds dare to grow.  A small pier is anchored into the
shore to the north, jutting out into the low-lying shallows of the lake. 
The hard packed ground continues to the east and west, and the center of the
village lies southward.
