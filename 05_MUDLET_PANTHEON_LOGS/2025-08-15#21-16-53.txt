Raddin Street
  Raddin Street, named after an ancient hero from the War of Fire, wends
its way east and west through Var Bandor.  Once a thriving part of town
known for its reputation as a home for men of action, it now serves as the
stomping ground for Var Bandor's cheaper hired swords.  Raddin Street
deadends at a stone wall to the east, and returns to the west.  North is a
run-down flophouse, and a large tavern to the south is decorated with a sign
proclaiming it to be the Tipsy Swordmaster.  

[Exits: (north) east south west]
     A tight feather collar is here.
A battered and scarred gladiator guards the entrance to the tavern.

Discount Guides of Var Bandor
  A small room fronts this establishment, a curtained-off door concealing
anything further in.  A creaky old desk fills entirely too much of the room,
covered in papers and carefully-stacked scrolls.  The walls are covered in
old handbills announcing bounties long since collected, gladiatorial bouts
from at least a year ago, and a few advertisments for local shops.  The
floor is kept cleaner than anything else in the place, and it too bears the
signs of too many feet walking over it.

A Dingy Office
  This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

<578hp 518m 296mv> 
The Wheelwright's
  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.  

[Exits: north]
(12) A long, iron file is here, its tip sharpened to a point.
     A sturdy shoulder-bag made from hide is here.
     A huge, wooden wheel is here lying broken on the ground.
A messenger strides along the street with a delivery.
Terintbanch is here bending pieces of metal and wood to his will.
Terintbanch Plun says, 'Greetings, Sir.'

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

natural light, providing a view of the streets through the bubbled glass.  A
seat is built under the western window, with room for two.  A few brightly
painted tables occupy the space, notably a long magenta table and a round
teal table.  The walls are a soft, inviting yellow and decorated with local
art.  A large counter displays a plethora of baked goods and supports a
heavy, steaming apparatus.  Further in, an oven is kept warm and the bakery
shelves stocked.  A staircase leads up to a private apartment.

Sadrent Road
  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city--a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  To the
east is Sadrent Road.

The Wheelwright's
  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.

note read       : either by number, or read next to read unread notes 
note remove     : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of 
note catchup    : markes all notes as read 

writing new notes: 
note to         : sets the to line (playername, housename, immortal, or all) 
note subject    : sets the subject for a new note 
note +          : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!) 
note -          : remove a line from a note in progress 
note edit       : edit the body of your note* 
note clear      : erase a note in progress

note show       : shows the note you are working on 
note post       : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note. 

* Of particular importance is the 'note edit' command. The editor will 
allow you to enter the body of your note directly, and to format your 
note. For help on the editor, see help EDITOR. 

Note REPLY and REPLYALL may be given a parameter of a message number to 
specify a message other than the last read to reply to. 

Additionally, if you place the word 'hidden' into the list of recipients (eg, 
"note to hidden Iandir Jolinn Guardian immortal"), other PCs will not be 
able to see the to-list of your note. 

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads

Dantaron Street
  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.

shop.  You can exit back to the west.

  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some

here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North

  The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.

The assassin is a unique blend of caladaran monastic living and deadly skill.
Although its roots are as ancient as societies themselves, modern assassinry
has evolved into a vast racial tapestry.  This unusual blend of elements
includes aelin acrobatics, srryn and kankoran knowledge of poisonous plants,
the cold-hearted precision of the shuddeni, and Adrajisk's ginta'cham'akan.
Due to their vast knowledge and cruel lusts, it is unsurprising that the
shuddeni are credited with many of the assassin's deadliest talents.

Assassins are proficient with many weapons, but begin with the rudiments of
unarmed combat.  Focused on both hand and foot, the assassin is well versed
in anatomy, able to strike precisely at nerve points or swiftly plant multiple
kicks in succession.  They trend also toward the dagger, and are able to use
its sharp point to hamper foes or swiftly stab the unconscious.  Their final
and possibly deadliest weapon is their own mind; with it, they can shroud the
perception of others or bolster their own physical prowess.

The art of death is what binds the brotherhood of the assassin, thus allowing
them maximum flexibility in the beliefs to which they adhere.  Assassins in
general tend to venerate whatever deity suits their ends, often aligning with
Arkhural the Darkheart or Calaera the Ishia.  However, those of particularly
lawful mind find other deities, or the Guardians of Law, with which to further
their interests.  Yet, no belief may be necessary at all, other than the will
to efficiently take lives.

The focus command allows a mentalist to exert one of his or her psionic
powers, similarly to the way a scholar or templar uses the cast command.

Some psionic foci produce an instantaneous effect, while most exert a
continuous influence. Lasting psionic effects drain mana from the mentalist
for as long as they are in effect. Unlike magical effects, psionic influences
last until their victim can overcome the will of the mentalists, rather than
having a fixed duration. Initiating a focus costs double the per-tick
maintenence cost of a given ability.

Psionicists can maintain a maximum of eight foci at once, spread over a set of
'slots'. Some foci will require more than one focus slot to maintain, and the
total number of slots available will increase over the course of the
psionicist's career, beginning at four. Every ten levels, he will gain access
to another slot. Assassins, on the other hand, gain a maximum of four slots
over their lifetime, gaining their first at level ten, then one every eleven
levels following that.

To get a list of their currently maintained foci, the focus command by itself
will provide the mentalist with a list.

To end a focus, a mentalist can unfocus the slot number (given in the focus
list).

A mentalist may view a list of the foci he will gain over the course of his
career with the abilities command, rather than skills or spells.

North Wall of the Temple of Darkness
  Earendam's temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the altar which sits here against
the north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  The altar here is made from
carved ebony, cunningly crafted with the symbols of the order which tends
this temple.  Set on the altar are smoldering censers, which fill the
surrounding air with the smell of myrrh.

The Dantaron River
  The placid waters of the Dantaron make their entrance to the city of
Earendam here.  Passing through a raised portcullis from the west, it winds
its way eastward through the city.  The waters of the Dantaron are deep
here, clouded by the dark mud of its bottom, and the frequent river-traffic
along its course.

By the Earendam Docks
  The Dantaron River flows from the plains to the east, making its way
under the city wall of Earendam to the west, and eventually to the Uthlin
Ocean.  To the north and south the river is lined with the Earendam docks
area, bustling with merchants unloading cargo and passengers disembarking
from barges.  Narrow wooden walkways run from one dock to the next, passing
just overhead.

The Earendam Docks
  A wide wooden docks has been erected just to the north of the River
Dantaron, flowing sluggishly to the south under the city wall.  The docks
are clear of clutter, incoming cargo being regulated closely and required to
move immediately.  An occasional raft or barge can be seen on the river,
arriving or leaving the city.  To the east, the granite walls of Earendam
tower above the dock area.  Several ladders and wooden walkways lead
downward to the water of the river itself.

stone pillars.  Reinforcing these gates are several stout bars of iron,
treated to preserve them from wear.  Outside the gates, the Arien Road heads
west, cutting across the plains which give it its namesake.  Inside, the

  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza

wander through the area, mainly heading to, or coming from the west gate of

winds eastward into the part of the city known as New Earendam.  The
merchants who mill about the other parts of the plaza thin here, and the
travelers heading east here tend to be artisans or scholars of one form or

The Center of Arien Plaza
  The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

  The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North

other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used.

it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting

to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used.

Iron Street
  Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city; in fact,
a faint air of oppression hangs over all the working class folk of Iron
Street.  To the east is Sadrent Road, and south is the wheelwright's.  North
is an old house.

  Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads
through the industrial section of Var Bandor.  To the east, the scent of
fresh bread wafts from a corner bakery.

seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded

  Dantaron Street bisects the west half of Var Bandor, leading from Center
Square to the docks outside the western gatehouse.  Sailors and dockmen
abound in this section of the city, wandering the streets while off-duty. 
The street is composed of well-worn cobblestones, with a few broken and
missing.  To the north, a large temple constructed of fine white marble
rises over the street.  To the south is a traveller's inn.  

[Exits: north east south west]
An enforcer of Var Bandor patrols here, scrutinizing every passing face.

Center Square
  A burbling fountain dominates the center of the square.  The fountain is
made of gray marble veined with blue.  Large sculptures of dancing otters
and leaping trout, gazing skyward and spouting water from their mouths, sit
within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.  

[Exits: north east south west]
     A large marble fountain gurgles peacefully here.
A shifty-eyed vagrant stumbles along, glaring about spitefully.
A grey pigeon walks about tentatively, looking for scraps of food.
An armed enforcer of Var Bandor stands here.

Your description is:
A whip-thin, dark-skinned caladaran stoops here.  His face and skin, from
what show in gaps of his piecemeal armor, is dark brown and rugged and rough
as old oak bark.  His seemingly tough textured skin grows even thicker and
darker towards each of his joints.  His idly passive demeanor and often
downcast gaze make him seem humble or unobtrusive but bright green eyes
shimmer intelligently.  His lithe frame moves with the ease of obvious
training and he seems to usually gravitate towards empty space.  Lastly you
regard the two blades secured fast about his right side.  Varying in sizes
and work the two swords are bound in scabbards.  The hilt of each blade is
fairly close together and, at rest, hang low on his waist.  One of his
calloused hands seems to constantly linger about the hilt of one of the two
blades.  Overall he lurks, slinks, lingers in an attempt to be
inconspicious.
